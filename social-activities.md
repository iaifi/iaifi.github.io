## About
IAIFI members are encouraged to submit ideas for community building events/activities that they would like to organize. If the IAIFI Community Building committee approves the event (per the guidelines listed below), then participants will receive reimbursement (up to 10 USD per participant, maximum 250 USD per event) after the event.

## Guidelines
*Please note this is a request for future reimbursement, not for logistical support. If you have any questions, feel free to contact anyone on the IAIFI Project Management Team (iaifi-pm@mit.edu).*

* Each event/activity must have an Event Point Person, who must be a member of IAIFI. The Event Point Person will be in charge of coordinating the logistics, including communicating with participants about activity details and facilitating reimbursement.
* All events/activities must be advertised to all of IAIFI, but could be targeted to a subset if desired (e.g. an outing for first-year grad students in IAIFI). Events/activities will be advertised in the IAIFI Weekly Digest and Slack. 
* The budget is around 10 USD per participant, with a maximum of 250 USD total per event. 
* A minimum of 5 IAIFI members must attend the event/activity in order for it to be reimbursed.
* These funds can not be used to reimburse sales tax or alcohol.
* Reimbursement forms must be submitted within 30 days after the event/activity. 

## Process
* [Complete this form](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/11c9f5109efc4abd907ccde4a5d3d37e) with details of your event at least two weeks before your event/activity.
* The Community Building Committee will review the details and let you know the status within 5 business days.
* Your event/activity will be advertised in the next IAIFI weekly digest and the Event Point Person will be asked to share details on the IAIFI Slack. 
* After the event/activity, the Event Point Person will receive a form to complete to confirm that the event occurred and the number of participants. This will also include instructions for reimbursement, which the Event Point Person can forward to anyone who needs to be reimbursed.

## FAQ
* *Does each participant need to be reimbursed individually?* No, one person can cover the cost and be reimbursed the full amount (up to 10 USD per participant, maximum 250 USD).
* *What if the event/activity costs more than the maximum amount specified?* These funds are intended to subsidize activities. If they do not cover the full cost of the activity, participants will be expected to cover the difference. 
* *Can non-IAIFI members attend?* If you would like to invite people outside of IAIFI to your activity, you are welcome to do so, but these funds will only subsidize IAIFI participants. 
* *What if fewer than 5 IAIFI members attend the event/activity?* Unfortunately, we will not be able to reimburse costs for the activity if fewer than 5 IAIFI members participate. You are welcome to set up an RSVP form for planning purposes if you would like to ensure high enough participation. 
* *How many events/activities can be covered in a year?* We expect to be able to cover several events per year, but if we get many more requests than we anticipate, we may need to pause/adjust the program.
