The goal of the IAIFI is to advance knowledge of fundamental interactions from the smallest to the largest scales using innovative methods in AI built upon *ab initio* physics principles, while simultaneously advancing the foundations of AI. Specifically, we are targeting opportunities for *ab initio* AI to improve theory calculations, to improve experiments, and to advance the field of AI. While our work includes a broad spectrum of physics and AI applications, our core focus is developing the nascent field of *ab initio* AI itself.

## *Ab Initio* AI for Theory Calculations

For many physics problems, the governing equations that encode the fundamental physical laws are known. Undertaking key calculations within these frameworks, as is essential to test our understanding of the universe and guide physics discovery, however, can be computationally demanding or even intractable. A primary research area for the IAIFI is AI for such *ab initio* theory studies. AI for first-principles physics naturally requires approaches with specific features, such as guarantees of exactness, reproducibility, and robust handling of uncertainties.

The specific *ab initio* physics approaches that we are targeting include first-principles calculations within the Standard Model (SM) of nuclear and particle physics, work to understand physics beyond the SM in the framework of string theory, and theory calculations for astroparticle physics. Complementing these efforts is work towards approaches that do not use AI to study a known theory, but instead to determine what previously unknown theory underlies observations. While the target physics spans a wide range of frameworks and scales, success in these areas all rely intimately on our efforts to advance the field of AI itself with work in interpretability, speed, and incorporating physical symmetries into AI frameworks, *i.e.* to develop the field of *ab initio* AI.

## *Ab Initio* AI for Experiments

By developing the field of *ab initio* AI, the IAIFI is also impacting many experimental applications, *e.g.*, where *ab initio* principles inform the design of AI methods that are more easily verifiable using well-understood calibration data samples, leading to better quantification of uncertainties. We are working to improve the operations of and enhance the physics potential of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the Laser Interferometer Gravity Wave Observatory (LIGO), and astrophysical experiments relevant for the nascent field of multi-messenger astronomy. Our efforts in *ab initio* AI for experiment are symbiotic with our work to advance the field of AI itself, particularly with the focus on interpretability and speed. Finally, interpreting experimental results often requires fast model evaluation or simulation; improving these tasks naturally has much in common with our efforts to accelerate or make tractable *ab initio* physics theory calculations.

## *Ab Initio* AI for AI

As discussed above, *ab initio* AI promises to greatly improve theoretical and experimental physics in ways that we are only beginning to explore. In turn, the unique features of these physics applications offer compelling research opportunities in AI more broadly. For example, physical systems often feature exact or approximate symmetries. Exploiting these known invariances in data structures and algorithms is a key to developing efficient algorithms for physics applications, but is also likely to be transformative in broader contexts. Physics-informed architectures and hardware development promise advances in the speed of AI algorithms, and work in statistical physics is providing a theoretical foundation for understanding AI dynamics. The IAIFI is supporting these efforts that deeply entwine our *ab initio* AI research with our *ab inito* physics goals.
