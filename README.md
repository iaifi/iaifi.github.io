###  The Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions Website

The IAIFI webpage source is hosted in GitHub and built using GitHub Pages. It is possible to use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/iaifi/iaifi.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files; however, for most things it's easier to just build and run Jekyll locally.

Whenever a commit is made to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages that make up the IAIFI site, from the content in your Markdown files:

- About.md
- People.md
- Research.md

To-do: ADD MORE HERE.

#### Markdown

Since Jekyll converts the simple Markdown files into the html that makes up the site, most IAIFI website updates only require editing Markdown files in your favorite editor. For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
