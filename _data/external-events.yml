We employ thousands of spectra collected by NICER, applying machine learning methods to expedite spectral-fitting results. Specifically, we create a probabilistic model, utilizing a variational auto-encoder with a normalizing flow, trained to adopt a physical latent space, building on our earlier work. This neural network produces predictions for spectral-model parameters as well as their uncertainties."

However, existing methods often overlook the importance of activation-space information in guiding the merging process. In this talk, I will introduce Activation-Informed Merging (AIM), a novel technique that enhances the robustness and performance of merged models by incorporating activation-space insights. AIM is designed as a complementary framework that can be applied to any merging approach, preserving critical weights from the base model through principles drawn from continual learning and model compression. By utilizing a task-agnostic calibration set, AIM selectively prioritizes essential parameters, leading to significant performance improvements across multiple benchmarks, with up to a 40% increase in effectiveness."

A better understanding of such scientific processes to the extent that they can be simulated at scale using machine learning has the potential to deliver revolutionary impact across several fields‚Äîalready inaugurated by recent Nobel Prizes in Physics and Chemistry‚Äîpotentially leading to new scientific breakthroughs. However, unlike data-rich domains such as images, delivering on the currently unfulfilled promise of scientific discovery on real problems requires the development of a new generation of probabilistic and generative modeling methods. In this talk, I outline the key challenges inherent to scientific domains that invite new approaches to build generative models for scientific data types. Specifically, I will present FoldFlow which advances Geometric Generative Modeling of de novo protein design through the use of SE(3) Flow-matching to generate high-quality designable, diverse, and novel protein backbones. Anchored by the design principles in FoldFlow, I will then outline a blueprint for building the next wave of generative models for scientific discovery, by outlining how modern generative models can be used as generative samplers for equilibrium sampling from Boltzmann densities which encapsulates many premier problems in AI4Science applications."

However, their flexibility comes at a cost: most key problems in these systems, like finding proofs, are computationally undecidable. Nonetheless, humans routinely solve novel mathematical problems, write new programs and prove them correct. Crucially, we leverage our ability to learn, developing increasingly better heuristics and abstractions for our domains of interest. We do so even without specific goals other than making interesting discoveries. In this talk, I‚Äôll present my research addressing fundamental challenges arising in learning formal reasoning. First, I‚Äôll show how reinforcement learning and abstraction learning combined enable an agent to master sections from the Khan Academy algebra curriculum, and even reconstruct the human-designed curriculum using its learned abstractions, despite seeing problems in a random order. Then, I‚Äôll present my work on open-ended learning for theorem proving, where an agent learns from self-generated conjectures, bootstrapping its ability to prove human-written theorems despite only training on proofs it found by itself. Along the way, I‚Äôll present methods for interfacing symbolic and neural systems, with applications to program generation and verification, and discuss standing challenges in developing self-improving reasoning machines."

Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington<br>Title: Beyond Scaling: Frontiers of Retrieval-Augmented Language Models<br>Abstract: Large Language Models (LMs) have achieved remarkable progress by scaling training data and model sizes. However, they continue to face critical limitations, including hallucinations and outdated knowledge, which hinder their reliability‚Äîespecially in expert domains such as scientific research and software development. In this talk, I will argue that addressing these challenges requires moving beyond monolithic LMs and toward Augmented LMs‚Äîa new AI paradigm that designs, trains, and deploys LMs alongside complementary modules to enhance reliability and efficiency. Focusing on my research on Retrieval-Augmented LMs, one of the most impactful and widely adopted forms of Augmented LMs today, I will begin by presenting systematic analyses of current LM shortcomings and demonstrating how retrieval augmentation offers a more scalable and effective path forward. I will then discuss my work on establishing new foundations for these systems, including novel training approaches and retrieval mechanisms that enable LMs to dynamically adapt to diverse inputs. Finally, I will showcase the real-world impact of such models through OpenScholar, our fully open Retrieval-Augmented LM for assisting scientists in synthesizing literature‚Äînow used by over 30,000 researchers and practitioners worldwide. I will conclude by outlining my vision for the future of Augmented LMs, emphasizing advancements in abilities to handle heterogeneous modalities, more efficient and flexible integration with diverse components, and rigorous evaluation through interdisciplinary collaboration."

  event-details: "Speaker: Zachary Fried (Graduate Student, MIT)<br>Title: Automating Chemical Intuition for Molecular Identification and Prediction in Astronomical Observations <br>Abstract: When manually identifying molecules in radio astronomical observations, scientists often rely on 'chemical intuition' to evaluate the plausibility of each molecular candidate. This consideration is important, as the detected molecules are frequently chemically related due to shared environmental processes or common precursor compounds. However, this reliance on human intuition poses a challenge for automation, as replicating such reasoning in code is inherently difficult. To address this, we have developed a new framework that leverages machine learning-based embedding methods to analyze the regions of chemical space occupied by molecules detected in specific interstellar sources. This analysis of chemical space is then integrated into an automated line assignment algorithm. Additionally, by training a model to gain a structured understanding of chemical space, we can generate strong candidate molecules to search for in our astronomical data. In this presentation, I will describe our line-assignment algorithm and demonstrate its application to various interstellar sources."

  event-details: "Speaker: ChangHoon Hahn (Assistant Professor, University of Arizona)<br>Title: Reconstructing Quasar Spectra and Measuring the Ly$\alpha$ Forest with Spectrum Autoencoders <br>Abstract: Quasar spectra carry the imprint of foreground intergalactic medium (IGM) through absorption systems. In particular, absorption caused by neutral hydrogen gas, the 'Ly$\alpha$ forest,' is a key spectroscopic tracer for cosmological analyses used to measure cosmic expansion and test physics beyond the standard model. Despite their importance, current methods for measuring Ly$\alpha$ absorption require making strong assumptions on the shape of the intrinsic quasar continuum that bias Ly$\alpha$ analyses. In this talk, I will present SpenderQ, a ML-based approach for reconstructing intrinsic quasar spectra and measuring the Ly$\alpha$ forest directly from observations. SpenderQ leverages a spectrum autoencoder to learn a compact and redshift-invariant latent representation of quasar spectra, combined with an iterative procedure to identify and mask absorption regions in the spectra. I will demonstrate that SpenderQ accurately reconstructs the true intrinsic quasar spectra, including the broad LyŒ≤, LyŒ±, SiIV, CIV, and CIII emission lines, with percent-level precision. I will also show how SpenderQ provides physically meaningful latent encoding enables key downstream tasks such as classification and anomaly detection. Finally, I will discuss how SpenderQ will be applied to observations to provide unbiased LyŒ± forest measurements in cosmological, quasar, and IGM studies."

Everyone is welcome to attend!<br>Speaker: Benjamin Lahner (PhD Student, MIT)<br>Title: Aggregating fMRI datasets for training brain-optimized models of human vision<br>Abstract: Large-scale fMRI datasets are revolutionizing our understanding of the neural processes underlying human perception, driving new breakthroughs in neuroscience and computational modeling. Yet individual fMRI data collection efforts remain constrained by practical limitations in scan time, creating an inherent tradeoff between subjects, stimuli, and stimulus repetitions. This tradeoff often compromises stimuli diversity, data quality, and generalizability of findings such that even the largest fMRI datasets cannot fully leverage the power of high-parameter artificial neural network models and high-dimensional feature spaces. To overcome these challenges, we introduce MOSAIC (Meta-Organized Stimuli And fMRI Imaging data for Computational modeling): a scalable framework for aggregating fMRI responses across multiple subjects and datasets. We preprocessed and registered eight event-related fMRI vision datasets (Natural Scenes Dataset, Natural Object Dataset, BOLD Moments Dataset, BOLD5000, Human Actions Dataset, Deeprecon, Generic Object Decoding, and THINGS) to the fsLR32k cortical surface space with fMRIPrep to obtain 430,007 fMRI-stimulus pairs over 93 subjects and 162,839 unique stimuli. We estimated single-trial beta values with GLMsingle (Prince et al., 2022), obtaining parameter estimates of similar or higher quality than the originally published datasets. Critically, we curated the dataset by eliminating stimuli with perceptual similarity above a defined threshold to prevent test-train leakage. This rigorous pipeline resulted in a well-defined stimulus-response dataset with 144,360 training stimuli, 18,145 test stimuli, and 334 synthetic stimuli well-suited for building and evaluating robust models of human vision. We show preliminary results using MOSAIC to investigate how the internal representations between brain-optimized neural networks differ from task-optimized neural networks and perform a large-scale decoding analysis that highlights the importance of stimulus set diversity. This framework empowers the vision science community to collaboratively generate a scalable, generalizable foundation for studying human vision."

This model justified Rydberg‚Äôs formula, which empirically described the spectrum of this atom and predicted the existence of highly excited atomic states with remarkable exaggerated properties (huge size of the electron orbits, long life span, intense coupling with microwave fields and very strong interactions between these atoms at quasi-macroscopic distances). The experimental study of these atoms ‚Äì particularly of the circular Rydberg states of maximum angular momentum described by Bohr ‚Äì began half a century ago with the development of tunable lasers. Rydberg atoms have played a central role in the development of Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics, in experiments which have tested the principles of quantum mechanics by realizing in the laboratory some of the Gedankenexperiment conceived a hundred years ago by the founders of quantum physics, among which the famous ‚ÄúSchr√∂dinger cat‚Äù experiment. More recently, Rydberg atoms have been used in quantum simulation studies where, trapped in optical lattices, they are individually controlled, manipulated and detected by laser light. The physics of Rydberg atoms is thus closely associated with the history of quantum physics from its origins to its most recent developments, with the promise of more exciting advances in the years to come."

  event-details: "Giannis Daras, Learning Generative Models from Corrupted Data.<br>Abstract: In scientific applications, generative models are used to regularize solutions to inverse problems. The quality of the models depends on the quality of the data on which they are trained. While natural images are abundant, in scientific applications access to high-quality data is scarce, expensive, or even impossible. For example, in MRI the quality of the scan is proportional to the time spent in the scanner and in black-hole imaging, we can only access lossy measurements. Contrary to high-quality data, noisy samples are generally more accessible. If we had a method to transform noisy points into clean ones, e.g., by sampling from the posterior, we could address these challenges. A standard approach would be to use a pre-trained generative model as a prior. But how can we train these priors in the first place without having access to data? We show that one can escape this chicken-egg problem using diffusion-based algorithms that account for the corruption at training time. We present the first algorithm that provably recovers the distribution given only noisy samples of a fixed variance. We extend our algorithm to account for heterogeneous data where each training sample has a different noise level. The underlying mathematical tools can be generalized to linear measurements with the potential of accelerating MRI. Our method has deep connections to the literature on learning supervised models from corrupted data, such as SURE and Noise2X. Our framework opens exciting possibilities for generative modeling in data-constrained scientific applications. We are actively working on applying this to denoise proteins and we present some first results in this direction."

In this talk we will explore how to build algorithms that can uncover interpretable structure from large collections of unsupervised data like images and video. First, I will describe how to classify every pixel of a collection of images without any human annotations (Unsupervised semantic segmentation) by distilling self-supervised vision models. Second, we‚Äôll see how this basic idea leads us to a new unifying theory of representation learning, and I will show how 20 different common machine learning methods such as dimensionality reduction, clustering, contrastive learning, and spectral methods emerge from a single unified equation. Finally, we‚Äôll use this unified theory to create algorithms that can decode natural language just by watching unlabeled videos of people talking, without any knowledge of text. This work is the first step in our broader effort to translate animals using large scale, unsupervised, and interpretable learners, and the talk will conclude with some of our most recent efforts to analyze the complex vocalizations of Atlantic spotted dolphins."

This talk explores the relationship between equivariance, model calibration, and model confidence. In particular, we discuss bounds on calibration error for functions that are arbitrarily expressive except that they are constrained to be equivariant with respect to a group G. Following this, we discuss experiments related to Astrophysics and beyond that explore how these bounds manifest in practice."

The extraction of compact representations from these data helps identify meaningful patterns and understand their physical meaning. This talk focuses on three works that use deep learning and complex networks to achieve these goals. The first work shows how autoencoders can compress X-ray spectra into a low-dimensional latent space while preserving physical information. The second work shows that light curves can be aligned with textual summaries using contrastive learning. This alignment generates a shared compact multimodal representation of both modalities. Finally, the third work shows that complex networks can capture patterns in multimodal data, revealing anomalies (such as rare astrophysical sources)."

At its core, SMT estimates the score of mixture distributions between real and fake samples across multiple noise levels. Similar to consistency models, our approach supports both training from scratch (SMT) and distillation using a pretrained diffusion model, which we call Score-of-Mixture Distillation (SMD).

Building upon previous work by Fanaroff and Riley, who classified relativistic jets in radio galaxies on kiloparsec scales, we extend this classification to parsec scales, closer to the central supermassive black hole. This approach enables detailed study of jet spatial structures and can help enhance accuracy in global positioning systems. We define four morphological classes: single Gaussian source, double Gaussian source, and sources with single or double-sided jets. Synthetic models of AGN jets were generated to create a training dataset for a convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN was trained on these synthetic data and subsequently applied to classify 130 thousand AGN jet images from the Astrogeo database. The distribution of images into designated classes, predicted by CNN, qualitatively matches the expected outcome."

  event-details: "Hannes St√§rk and Bowen Jing, Generative Models for Biomolecular Prediction, Dynamics, and Design: We lay out the three avenues in which we think generative models are especially valuable for modeling biomolecules. 1) Hard prediction tasks can be better addressed with generative models that can suggest and rank multiple solutions (e.g. docking). 2) The dynamics and conformations of biomolecules can be captured with generative models (e.g. protein conformational ensembles and MD trajectories). 3) Designing new biomolecules can be accelerated, informed by samples or likelihoods from generative models (e.g. protein binder or regulatory DNA design). Refreshments (tea and pastry) will be served."
