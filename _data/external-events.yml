  event-details: "Helen Shao (Harvard) <br>Title: Signal-Preserving Machine Learning for Polarized CMB Reconstruction <br>Abstract:Accurate measurement of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) B-mode polarization, a key probe of inflationary physics, is hindered by complex astrophysical foreground contamination. Standard foreground reconstruction techniques like the Internal Linear Combination (ILC) method can mitigate this problem while preserving the CMB signal. However, they are limited to second-order statistics, neglecting non-Gaussian information that dominates the foregrounds. This work presents a novel, signal-preserving machine learning framework for foreground reconstruction, designed to overcome these limitations using only single-frequency data. To achieve this, we leverage the statistical independence of primary CMB modes across angular scales, contrasted with the significant inter-scale correlations present in Galactic foregrounds. We train convolutional neural networks and conditional diffusion models to predict and subtract large-scale foreground features (ℓ<200) using only small-scale map information (ℓ>200) as a signal-free input. This approach preserves the cosmological signal by construction. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness using PySM3 simulations of Galactic dust emission, showing improved foreground removal compared to baseline methods. We validate the performance of the neural networks using correlation metrics in both pixel and harmonic space. We present this framework as a pathway towards simplified component separation for next-generation CMB experiments, with ongoing work to assess generalization across different foreground models and sky regions."

Yet the statistical models most commonly applied to galaxies are generally oversimplified and cannot capture dependencies on environment or formation history. To address this, I will introduce Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), motivating their use and outlining their key features. GNNs are a general and powerful tool for physical modeling, able to naturally incorporate geometrical constraints, symmetries, and inductive biases (prior knowledge). This leads to both better and more robust models and enables us to ask detailed questions about the roles of environment and formation history in cosmological galaxy modeling. Finally, I will present a surprising equivalence between these two aspects of galaxy formation."

Everyone is welcome to attend!<br>Speaker 1: Emanuele Sansone<br>Title 1: Collapse-Proof Non-Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning<br>Abstract 1: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has unlocked the ability to learn general-purpose representations from vast amounts of unlabeled data. Despite its successes, significant challenges remain, limiting the applicability and democratization of SSL. One key challenge lies in the failure modes that arise during SSL training. In this talk, we distill essential principles for reliably avoiding these known collapses. We introduce a principled yet simplified design of the projector and loss function for non-contrastive SSL, grounded in hyperdimensional computing. Theoretically, we show that this design induces an inductive bias that naturally encourages representations to become both decorrelated and clustered, without explicitly enforcing these properties. This bias provably improves generalization and is sufficient to prevent common training failures, including representation, dimensional, cluster, and intracluster collapses. We further validate our theoretical insights on image datasets, showing that our approach produces representations that retain richer information about the observed data while avoiding memorization. This opens the door to learning more structured representations.<br>Speaker 2: Ittai Rubinstein<br>Title 2: Data Attribution in High Dimensions and without Strong Convexity<br>Abstract 2: Data attribution estimates the effect of removing a set of samples from a model's training set without retraining the model from scratch and are used for interpretability, credit assignment, privacy and more. However, key approaches to data attribution significantly underestimate removal effects in the high-dimensional regime (#params >= Omega(#samples)), and existing theoretical analyses require strong convexity assumptions that rarely hold in practice, even for simple linear probes. In this talk, we will present a correction to the leading approaches to data attribution that improve accuracy in the high-dimensional regime and present the first theoretical guarantees for the accuracy of data attribution without strong convexity."

  event-details: "Speaker 1: Constança Tropa (CfA/ETH) <br>Title: Probabilistic reconstruction of 3D peculiar velocity fields <br>Abstract:To study the properties of dark matter, we often turn to galaxies as a probe of the underlying matter density field. Beyond the expansion of the universe, the motions of galaxies are driven by the gravity of the surrounding structure. This peculiar velocity produces an additional Doppler shift in the observed redshift, introducing anisotropies in the clustering signal along the line of sight. If we know the peculiar velocities of the galaxies, we can correct for these redshift-space distortions and recover their positions in real space, allowing us to probe the underlying dark matter distribution more directly.<br>We present a framework that employs generative ML models to reconstruct these velocity fields while marginalising over parameters such as the growth rate and linear galaxy bias. Our dataset consists of 2000 QUIJOTE N-body simulations with varying cosmologies. We use normalising flows to estimate posterior distributions for Ωm, σ8, and the linear bias. We test how strongly different tracers constrain the posterior distribution, comparing summary statistics to full 3D fields, both in real and redshift space. We then make use of a diffusion model with a U-Net architecture to reconstruct velocities on small scales. Our model learns the flow that maps large-scale velocities, predicted from linear theory, onto non-linear small scales. Information on these small scales is incorporated by conditioning on the galaxy overdensity field. By sampling multiple realizations of the predicted fields, we capture the uncertainty in the peculiar motions of galaxies and therefore in their positions. <br><br>Speaker 2: Lea Heckmann (CNRS Paris)<br>Title: Statistical and Computational Advances in Blazar Studies: Leveraging Multi-Wavelength and Multi-Messenger Data<br>Abstract: Blazars are prime objects to investigate in the current multi-messenger era. Even though they have been studied for decades, we are still deciphering their underlying emission and acceleration mechanisms. In this talk, I would like to introduce two projects using novel methodologies to better exploit multi-messenger data of blazars.<br>The first project tests whether unsupervised learning applied on multiwavelength lightcurves  can identify emission states of blazars in a more unbiased way as done with current methods. Using extreme deconvolution, a Gaussian mixture model taking into account uncertainties on the input data, we test this approach on the long-term multiwavelength lightcurve of the blazar Mrk 501 and identify a range of emission states from high to low activity. Notably, we observe a distinctive relationship between radio and high-energy fluxes, suggesting the presence of multiple emission zones.<br>The second project aims to improve the connection between observational data with complex theoretical modeling. We are building a novel, user-friendly multi-messenger fitting approach built on the open-source package Gammapy. Our framework brings together observations from optical to very-high-energy gamma rays and operates directly on instrumental counts. However, its expansion to more complex theoretical models, such as the ones involving hadronic processes, challenges computation resources and times. To address this, we plan to explore machine learning techniques as a more efficient alternative to our current approach, which relies on parameter grids and interpolation."

Machine learning-based solvers turned out to be a promising direction, where problem patterns with certain distributions are captured to facilitate faster and more accurate problem-solving. We studied the theory and methodology of machine learning solvers for permutation-based combinatorial optimization and demonstrated the superiority of machine learning over existing methods. Going beyond, we transferred the insights to a long-standing problem in science with combinatorial nature—inferring molecular structures from liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, a current bottleneck in computational metabolomics. We developed neural networks for in silico fragmentation, surpassing existing approaches by a significant margin, achieving 40% accuracy for annotating the exact structure as the top prediction and 92% accuracy in top 10. We demonstrated the utility of our approach in life science, environmental science, chemistry, and biology by real-world case studies. We expect the continuation of the research will not only enable new capabilities in science but also establish new insights in machine learning research."

Everyone is welcome to attend!<br>Talk 1 Speaker: Aruna Sankaranarayanan (MIT) <br>Title: Activation Steering in Generative Settings via Contrastive Causal Mediation Analysis<br>Abstract: Where should we intervene on the internal activations of a large language model (LM) to control the naturalistic text it generates? Identifying effective steering locations in multi-token output settings is challenging because interventions can have complex, context-dependent effects, and evaluation often relies on costly human judgments or auxiliary models that provide only coarse feedback. To address this, we introduce contrastive causal mediation (CCM), a lightweight procedure for selecting steerable activation points by (1) constructing contrastive responses that succeed or fail in steering, (2) computing differences in generation probabilities, and (3) estimating the causal effect of hidden activations on these differences. We then situate CCM within a principled evaluation framework for representation engineering, which addresses four key desiderata: task-relevant contexts, consideration of model likelihoods, standardized comparisons across behaviors, and baseline methods. On 3 models, and across 3 task settings—refusal, bias-aware feedback, and style transfer, we conduct over 5400 experiments to show that CCM identifies effective intervention points under this recommended evaluation strategy. Together, these contributions demonstrate how combining causally grounded mechanistic interpretability with rigorous evaluation enables more effective and trustworthy control of large language models, even in naturalistic settings.<br><br>Talk 2 Speaker:  Justin Kay (MIT) <br>Title: Consensus-Driven Active Model Selection<br>Abstract: The widespread availability of off-the-shelf machine learning models poses a challenge: which model, of the many available candidates, should be chosen for a given data analysis task? This question of model selection is traditionally answered by collecting and annotating a validation dataset -- a costly and time-intensive process. We propose a method for active model selection, using predictions from candidate models to prioritize the labeling of test data points that efficiently differentiate the best candidate. Our method, CODA, performs consensus-driven active model selection by modeling relationships between classifiers, categories, and data points within a probabilistic framework. The framework uses the consensus and disagreement between models in the candidate pool to guide the label acquisition process, and Bayesian inference to update beliefs about which model is best as more information is collected. We validate our approach by curating a collection of 26 benchmark tasks capturing a range of model selection scenarios. CODA outperforms existing methods for active model selection significantly, reducing the annotation effort required to discover the best model by upwards of 70% compared to the previous state-of-the-art. Our contribution is part of a larger research goal of how to best utilize human effort in the AI development and deployment lifecycle; while much prior research has focused on this question at training time, our work highlights the outsized benefits of emphasizing label-efficiency at test time as well."

How Human Brains and Neural Networks look for stuff differently <br>Abstract:Visual Search is the process of deciding 'where to look next' in a context where the center of our visual field contains more information than the periphery. Convolutional feed-forward Neural Networks were inspired in how the visual cortex processes information, and kick-started the deep learning revolution when ImageNet was 'solved'. In this talk, we'll explore how CNNs structural similarity to the brain leads to unexpected similarity in higher order emergent behavior. Transformers instead are structured to maximally leverage modern parallel computing, focusing more on the physicality of GPUs rather than that of Neurons. Consequently, they produce richer semantic concepts, but in an alien manner. In this talk we'll talk about the computational modelling of human visual search as performed by the brain, by leveraging both by CNNs and transformers. Then, we'll talk about how some tools originally from neuroscience (SAEs and probes) can conversely be used to understand AI."

  event-details: "Speaker: Alan Hsu (Harvard) <br>Title: Dynamic Tomographic Inversion of Solar Coronal Magnetic Fields using Neural Rendering <br>Abstract:We propose to develop a neural-rendering-based method for dynamic 3D reconstruction of magnetic and plasma fields in the solar corona. Neural rendering is a machine learning approach for 3D reconstruction of objects and scenes using a sparse set of 2D viewpoints. These learned models, called Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), map a positional state to the emitted intensity, and reconstruct the 3D object by integrating the LOS emission. By learning on a sparse set of measured 2D viewpoints of the object, NeRFs effectively act as a proxy for the intrinsic emissivity properties, and can render novel viewpoints that would otherwise be unmeasurable. In this project, we will combine existing methods for tomographic inversion of coronal magnetic fields with existing neural rendering techniques to create a physics-informed model that performs a continuous mapping between the spatial position within the corona and its associated magnetic field and plasma properties. While our coronal NeRF (corNeRF) will eventually be used for tomographic inversion of observational spectropolarimetric data, we will train and validate our models using simulated observations synthesized from MHD models so that we have the ground truth values. The goal of the proposed work is to demonstrate that corNeRFs are able to accurately reconstruct the 3D magnetic and plasma fields of the solar corona, so that they can be practically used on tomographic inversions of spectropolarimetric observations of the corona when the ground truth magnetic fields are not known."

We employ thousands of spectra collected by NICER, applying machine learning methods to expedite spectral-fitting results.

  event-details: "Speaker: Sebastian Ratzenboeck (CfA)<br>Title: Learning with Gaps: A Domain-Adaptive ML Framework for Mapping Young Stars from Incomplete, Multi-Survey Data <br>Abstract: Identifying young stellar objects (YSOs) in the solar neighborhood is key to understanding the Galactic baryon cycle. By tracing where and when stars form, disperse, and inject energy into the interstellar medium, we gain insight into the processes that regulate star formation and feedback. Recent advances in 3D dust mapping and the availability of multi-wavelength data from surveys like Spitzer, WISE, Gaia, LAMOST, and APOGEE open the door to building a high-resolution 3D census of young stars. However, effectively using this data is challenging: surveys differ in wavelength coverage, sensitivity, and resolution; most stars are only partially observed; and simulations differ systematically from real observations. Traditional simulation-based inference (SBI) methods are poorly suited to this setting, as they assume complete, noise-homogeneous, and simulation-faithful data.<br>We present a domain-adaptive, multi-survey SBI framework designed to address these challenges. The model learns a shared latent space between synthetic and real data using survey-specific adapters and modality-specific encoders. It aligns simulations and observations through optimal transport and contrastive learning, and additionally uses cross-survey spectral pairs to improve consistency. Crucially, the architecture supports arbitrary combinations of photometric and spectroscopic inputs, handles missing modalities naturally, and enables inference across highly heterogeneous data regimes.<br>At its core is a transformer-based flow matching model trained to learn the full joint distribution over stellar parameters (e.g. age, distance, extinction, Teff, logg) and observations. This allows flexible conditioning and marginalization over any subset of inputs at inference time. By unifying simulations and observations in a single probabilistic framework, our approach enables accurate YSO characterization and paves the way for a bias-aware 3D map of recent star formation in the solar neighborhood."

As astronomical datasets continue to grow in size and complexity, associated challenges continue to emerge, such as infrastructure for storage and access to datasets, evolution of data format through survey lifespans, preserving discovery potential in the era of overwhelming data sizes, and ensuring the continuing development of astronomical knowledge while minimising the environmental impact of computations.<br>In recognition of these challenges we invite abstracts on advances in distributed data processing, effective data access, rapid data analysis, computational infrastructure, accessible toolkits and pipelines for data analysis using automated approaches. We will also explore cutting-edge statistical inference techniques, particularly focusing on simulation-based and deep learning approaches to inference in our 2-day scientific session at the European Week of Astronomy in Cork, Ireland."

  event-details: "Speaker: Javier Roulet (Caltech) <br>Title: Equivariant learning for simulation-based gravitational wave inference <br>Abstract: Over the last decade, the LIGO and Virgo interferometers have detected gravitational waves from about a hundred compact object mergers, a number that will double in the next months with releases from their fourth observing run. These detections have revolutionized astrophysics, among other achievements identifying the kilonova explosion from a binary neutron star merger and constraining the formation mechanisms of compact binaries.<br>Such discoveries require robust and efficient inference algorithms, for which machine learning is being increasingly used with varying degrees of success. Gravitational wave inference is challenging for machine-learning methods due to the large variety of shapes that signals can take. I will discuss how this diversity is largely accounted for by approximate symmetries in the signal model, where variations in the system parameters induce predictable amplitude and phase modulations in the gravitational wave. We construct an approximately invariant representation under this symmetry group, by normalizing the observed data against a reference waveform and the inferred parameters against a semi-analytical prediction. This compression reduces the variability of the data and simplifies the geometry of the likelihood, improving the training efficiency, performance, and interpretability of a simulation-based inference model. The resulting method is 3-4 orders of magnitude faster than classic likelihood-based algorithms; I will suggest possible applications for gravitational wave detection that exploit this tremendous speedup."

Brain data is too complex for traditional statistical techniques to provide much traction in decoding, though, and there is general agreement that deep learning approaches are necessary. However, deep learning requires large-scale datasets, which presents a challenge for neural data, because neural data is highly heterogeneous, with each recording involving different subjects, modalities, species, brain regions, stimuli, behaviour, and health states. How can we train a single model across such diverse data? Here, I will present new techniques that we have developed for training neural decoding models across diverse data. Using novel tokenization approaches, we show that we can build large-scale, transformer-based neural decoding models that can take advantage of diverse data coming from different subjects, stimuli/behaviour, brain regions, cell types, and even species. We show that our model improves as we add more diverse data, indicating that training a neural decoding model at scale is possible, as long as the system is designed to take advantage of the diversity in neural datasets."

In ground-based spectroscopy, it can be difficult to distinguish the sharp LAE peak from residual sky emission lines, leading to misclassified redshifts. We present a Bayesian spectral component separation technique to automatically determine spectroscopic redshifts for LAEs while marginalizing over sky residuals. We use visually inspected DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument) LAE targets to create a data-driven prior and can determine redshift by jointly inferring sky residual, LAE, and residual components for each individual spectrum. We demonstrate this method on 910 photometrically targeted z = 2-4 DESI LAE candidate spectra and determine their redshifts with >90% accuracy compared to visually inspected redshifts. Using the chi-squared value from our pipeline as a proxy for detection confidence, we then explore potential survey design choices and implications for targeting LAEs with medium-band photometry. This method allows for scalability and accuracy in determining spectroscopic redshifts in DESI and the results provide recommendations for LAE targeting in anticipation of future high-redshift spectroscopic surveys, such as DESI-2."

In this talk, I will suggest that approaches from cognitive science can provide useful tools for approaching these questions. Specifically, I will focus on rational analysis: analyzing behavior as a rational adaptation to an environment. I’ll  first illustrate these ideas by discussing some of our work analyzing how the in-context learning abilities of language models can emerge as a rational adaptation to simple properties of the data distribution they are trained on. I’ll then discuss how this analysis extends to suggest that many of language models broader success and failures can be interpreted as rational responses to the natural data distribution — including cases where language models exhibit some of the same patterns of content entangled reasoning that humans do. Finally, I’ll illustrate how rational analysis implies that the contextual abilities of language models can overcome failures like the “reversal curse” — and how to exploit these insights to improve generalization."

Everyone is welcome to attend!<br>Speaker: Justin Chen (PhD Student, MIT) <br>Title: Algorithm Design with Learned Predictions<br>Abstract: The classic framing of algorithm design goes something like this: I give you a mathematical formulation of a problem by specifying valid inputs and outputs, and you give me an algorithm which, on any input, will produce a valid output using limited resources (e.g., time or memory). This “worst-case” analysis, which guarantees algorithmic correctness and efficiency over all possible inputs, is the foundation of computer science theory. This is for good reason: algorithms designed to perform well in the worst-case are reliable, composable, and require no assumptions or prior knowledge of their applications.<br>In modern applications, algorithms are not run once in a vacuum on an unknown input. Procedures which process huge amounts of data are run hour after hour, day after day, on similar input datasets. These data may contain structure which is hard to formally incorporate into the algorithmic problem description. On the other hand, machine learning excels at extracting patterns which do not necessarily conform to simple-to-state, mathematical rules. Learned models make probabilistic predictions of outputs given inputs without a formal problem description or algorithm designer; they tune themselves on training data.<br>In this talk, I will overview the developing area of 'algorithms with predictions' as well as several opportunities and challenges with approaching ML for algorithms."

  event-details: "Speaker:  Arne Thomsen (ETH Zurich)<br>Title: Simulation-based inference of cosmology from multi-probe maps using deep learning<br>Abstract: The ongoing Dark Energy Survey (DES) is designed to observe the large-scale structure of the Universe using a number of cosmological probes, including weak gravitational lensing and galaxy clustering. Conventionally, constraints on the cosmological parameters are calculated by comparing two-point functions of the observables with semi-analytical theory predictions. However, we know that due to nonlinear structure formation at late times, the physical fields contain non-Gaussian information which is not captured by the two-point functions. In this talk, I present a pipeline to leverage numerical theory predictions and the expressive power of deep learning to extract this additional cosmological information by learning the (beyond Gaussian) summary statistic instead. More specifically, we present our analysis framework for simulation-based inference in three parts: 1) a forward model to generate DES-like weak gravitational lensing and galaxy clustering maps from the CosmoGridV1 suite of simulations, 2) a pipeline to train artificial neural networks to find low-dimensional features that maximize the cosmological information gain from these forward-modeled maps, 3) a flexible inference workflow to obtain the posterior distribution of the cosmological and astrophysical parameters, given a (mock) observation. So far, we have applied the above to synthetic observations for forecasting and validation, comparing our approach to a power-spectrum baseline. We are currently preparing the whole pipeline for application to the real survey data, putting an emphasis on its validation."

Everyone is welcome to attend!<br>Speaker: Shuvom Sadhuka (PhD Student, MIT) <br>Title: Evaluating multiple models using labeled and unlabeled data<br>Abstract: It remains difficult to evaluate machine learning classifiers in the absence of a large, labeled dataset. While labeled data can be prohibitively expensive or impossible to obtain, unlabeled data is plentiful. Here, we introduce Semi-Supervised Model Evaluation (SSME), a method that uses both labeled and unlabeled data to evaluate machine learning classifiers. SSME is the first evaluation method to take advantage of the fact that: (i) there are frequently multiple classifiers for the same task, (ii) continuous classifier scores are often available for all classes, and (iii) unlabeled data is often far more plentiful than labeled data. The key idea is to use a semi-supervised mixture model to estimate the joint distribution of ground truth labels and classifier predictions. We can then use this model to estimate any metric that is a function of classifier scores and ground truth labels (e.g., accuracy or expected calibration error). We present experiments in four domains where obtaining large labeled datasets is often impractical: (1) healthcare, (2) content moderation, (3) molecular property prediction, and (4) image annotation. Our results demonstrate that SSME estimates performance more accurately than do competing methods, reducing error by 5.1× relative to using labeled data alone and 2.4× relative to the next best competing method. SSME also improves accuracy when evaluating performance across subsets of the test distribution (e.g., specific demographic subgroups) and when evaluating the performance of language models."

Many benchmarks have been created to track LLMs' growing capabilities, however there has been no similar focus on measuring their reliability. To understand the potential ramifications of this gap, we investigate how well current benchmarks quantify model reliability. We find that pervasive label errors can compromise these evaluations, obscuring lingering model failures and hiding unreliable behavior. Motivated by this gap in the evaluation of reliability, we then propose the concept of so-called platinum benchmarks, i.e., benchmarks carefully curated to minimize label errors and ambiguity. As a first attempt at constructing such benchmarks, we revise examples from fifteen existing popular benchmarks. We evaluate a wide range of models on these platinum benchmarks and find that, indeed, frontier LLMs still exhibit failures on simple tasks such as elementary-level math word problems. Analyzing these failures further reveals previously unidentified patterns of problems on which frontier models consistently struggle."

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can now reliably predict galaxies’ physical properties, including cold gas content and metallicity, directly from three-color optical images. These models can even reconstruct entire optical spectra from imaging alone. Highly optimized CNNs can also robustly identify nearby dwarf galaxies from wide-area surveys, significantly expanding the sample of known satellite systems at low redshifts. Meanwhile, graph neural networks (GNNs) can encode the large-scale environment from cosmological simulations, and represent its impacts on the galaxy–halo connection. These applications demonstrate how explainable ML models with strong inductive biases can enable new scientific insights in galaxy evolution and cosmology. With upcoming wide-area surveys from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, and Euclid, advanced ML and interpretable AI methods will play an increasingly vital role in extracting physical understanding from cosmic datasets."

In this talk, I will discuss the application of unsupervised machine learning, specifically the Self-Organizing Map (SOM), to study the spectral energy distribution (SED) space of galaxies. Our goal is to bridge photometry and spectroscopy by training an ML model on photometric data to predict spectroscopic features, reducing the high cost and time demands of spectroscopy.<br>Using data from the CANDELS and KECK MOSDEF surveys at z ~ 1.5 and z ~ 2.2, we trained a SOM on photometric data and mapped spectroscopic data onto it to analyze sample selection biases and galaxy properties. Our findings reveal that MOSDEF AGNs preferentially occupy the more massive regions of the SOM, confirming known selection biases toward high-mass, less dusty galaxies. We also examined metallicity variations across the SOM, showing that more massive galaxies exhibit lower [O III]/Hβ and [O III]/[O II] ratios and higher Hα/Hβ ratios, consistent with the mass-metallicity relation. These results highlight the potential of SOMs in uncovering trends in multidimensional datasets and improving AGN and galaxy population studies."

In this talk, I will introduce Activation-Informed Merging (AIM), a novel technique that enhances the robustness and performance of merged models by incorporating activation-space insights. AIM is designed as a complementary framework that can be applied to any merging approach, preserving critical weights from the base model through principles drawn from continual learning and model compression. By utilizing a task-agnostic calibration set, AIM selectively prioritizes essential parameters, leading to significant performance improvements across multiple benchmarks, with up to a 40% increase in effectiveness."

A better understanding of such scientific processes to the extent that they can be simulated at scale using machine learning has the potential to deliver revolutionary impact across several fields—already inaugurated by recent Nobel Prizes in Physics and Chemistry—potentially leading to new scientific breakthroughs. However, unlike data-rich domains such as images, delivering on the currently unfulfilled promise of scientific discovery on real problems requires the development of a new generation of probabilistic and generative modeling methods. In this talk, I outline the key challenges inherent to scientific domains that invite new approaches to build generative models for scientific data types. Specifically, I will present FoldFlow which advances Geometric Generative Modeling of de novo protein design through the use of SE(3) Flow-matching to generate high-quality designable, diverse, and novel protein backbones. Anchored by the design principles in FoldFlow, I will then outline a blueprint for building the next wave of generative models for scientific discovery, by outlining how modern generative models can be used as generative samplers for equilibrium sampling from Boltzmann densities which encapsulates many premier problems in AI4Science applications."

However, their flexibility comes at a cost: most key problems in these systems, like finding proofs, are computationally undecidable. Nonetheless, humans routinely solve novel mathematical problems, write new programs and prove them correct. Crucially, we leverage our ability to learn, developing increasingly better heuristics and abstractions for our domains of interest. We do so even without specific goals other than making interesting discoveries. In this talk, I’ll present my research addressing fundamental challenges arising in learning formal reasoning. First, I’ll show how reinforcement learning and abstraction learning combined enable an agent to master sections from the Khan Academy algebra curriculum, and even reconstruct the human-designed curriculum using its learned abstractions, despite seeing problems in a random order. Then, I’ll present my work on open-ended learning for theorem proving, where an agent learns from self-generated conjectures, bootstrapping its ability to prove human-written theorems despite only training on proofs it found by itself. Along the way, I’ll present methods for interfacing symbolic and neural systems, with applications to program generation and verification, and discuss standing challenges in developing self-improving reasoning machines."

However, they continue to face critical limitations, including hallucinations and outdated knowledge, which hinder their reliability—especially in expert domains such as scientific research and software development. In this talk, I will argue that addressing these challenges requires moving beyond monolithic LMs and toward Augmented LMs—a new AI paradigm that designs, trains, and deploys LMs alongside complementary modules to enhance reliability and efficiency. Focusing on my research on Retrieval-Augmented LMs, one of the most impactful and widely adopted forms of Augmented LMs today, I will begin by presenting systematic analyses of current LM shortcomings and demonstrating how retrieval augmentation offers a more scalable and effective path forward. I will then discuss my work on establishing new foundations for these systems, including novel training approaches and retrieval mechanisms that enable LMs to dynamically adapt to diverse inputs. Finally, I will showcase the real-world impact of such models through OpenScholar, our fully open Retrieval-Augmented LM for assisting scientists in synthesizing literature—now used by over 30,000 researchers and practitioners worldwide. I will conclude by outlining my vision for the future of Augmented LMs, emphasizing advancements in abilities to handle heterogeneous modalities, more efficient and flexible integration with diverse components, and rigorous evaluation through interdisciplinary collaboration."

This consideration is important, as the detected molecules are frequently chemically related due to shared environmental processes or common precursor compounds. However, this reliance on human intuition poses a challenge for automation, as replicating such reasoning in code is inherently difficult. To address this, we have developed a new framework that leverages machine learning-based embedding methods to analyze the regions of chemical space occupied by molecules detected in specific interstellar sources. This analysis of chemical space is then integrated into an automated line assignment algorithm. Additionally, by training a model to gain a structured understanding of chemical space, we can generate strong candidate molecules to search for in our astronomical data. In this presentation, I will describe our line-assignment algorithm and demonstrate its application to various interstellar sources."

In particular, absorption caused by neutral hydrogen gas, the 'Ly$\alpha$ forest,' is a key spectroscopic tracer for cosmological analyses used to measure cosmic expansion and test physics beyond the standard model. Despite their importance, current methods for measuring Ly$\alpha$ absorption require making strong assumptions on the shape of the intrinsic quasar continuum that bias Ly$\alpha$ analyses. In this talk, I will present SpenderQ, a ML-based approach for reconstructing intrinsic quasar spectra and measuring the Ly$\alpha$ forest directly from observations. SpenderQ leverages a spectrum autoencoder to learn a compact and redshift-invariant latent representation of quasar spectra, combined with an iterative procedure to identify and mask absorption regions in the spectra. I will demonstrate that SpenderQ accurately reconstructs the true intrinsic quasar spectra, including the broad Lyβ, Lyα, SiIV, CIV, and CIII emission lines, with percent-level precision. I will also show how SpenderQ provides physically meaningful latent encoding enables key downstream tasks such as classification and anomaly detection.

Everyone is welcome to attend!<br>Speaker: Benjamin Lahner (PhD Student, MIT)<br>Title: Aggregating fMRI datasets for training brain-optimized models of human vision<br>Abstract: Large-scale fMRI datasets are revolutionizing our understanding of the neural processes underlying human perception, driving new breakthroughs in neuroscience and computational modeling. Yet individual fMRI data collection efforts remain constrained by practical limitations in scan time, creating an inherent tradeoff between subjects, stimuli, and stimulus repetitions. This tradeoff often compromises stimuli diversity, data quality, and generalizability of findings such that even the largest fMRI datasets cannot fully leverage the power of high-parameter artificial neural network models and high-dimensional feature spaces. To overcome these challenges, we introduce MOSAIC (Meta-Organized Stimuli And fMRI Imaging data for Computational modeling): a scalable framework for aggregating fMRI responses across multiple subjects and datasets. We preprocessed and registered eight event-related fMRI vision datasets (Natural Scenes Dataset, Natural Object Dataset, BOLD Moments Dataset, BOLD5000, Human Actions Dataset, Deeprecon, Generic Object Decoding, and THINGS) to the fsLR32k cortical surface space with fMRIPrep to obtain 430,007 fMRI-stimulus pairs over 93 subjects and 162,839 unique stimuli. We estimated single-trial beta values with GLMsingle (Prince et al., 2022), obtaining parameter estimates of similar or higher quality than the originally published datasets. Critically, we curated the dataset by eliminating stimuli with perceptual similarity above a defined threshold to prevent test-train leakage. This rigorous pipeline resulted in a well-defined stimulus-response dataset with 144,360 training stimuli, 18,145 test stimuli, and 334 synthetic stimuli well-suited for building and evaluating robust models of human vision. We show preliminary results using MOSAIC to investigate how the internal representations between brain-optimized neural networks differ from task-optimized neural networks and perform a large-scale decoding analysis that highlights the importance of stimulus set diversity. This framework empowers the vision science community to collaboratively generate a scalable, generalizable foundation for studying human vision."

This model justified Rydberg’s formula, which empirically described the spectrum of this atom and predicted the existence of highly excited atomic states with remarkable exaggerated properties (huge size of the electron orbits, long life span, intense coupling with microwave fields and very strong interactions between these atoms at quasi-macroscopic distances). The experimental study of these atoms – particularly of the circular Rydberg states of maximum angular momentum described by Bohr – began half a century ago with the development of tunable lasers. Rydberg atoms have played a central role in the development of Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics, in experiments which have tested the principles of quantum mechanics by realizing in the laboratory some of the Gedankenexperiment conceived a hundred years ago by the founders of quantum physics, among which the famous “Schrödinger cat” experiment. More recently, Rydberg atoms have been used in quantum simulation studies where, trapped in optical lattices, they are individually controlled, manipulated and detected by laser light. The physics of Rydberg atoms is thus closely associated with the history of quantum physics from its origins to its most recent developments, with the promise of more exciting advances in the years to come."

  event-details: "Giannis Daras, Learning Generative Models from Corrupted Data.<br>Abstract: In scientific applications, generative models are used to regularize solutions to inverse problems. The quality of the models depends on the quality of the data on which they are trained. While natural images are abundant, in scientific applications access to high-quality data is scarce, expensive, or even impossible. For example, in MRI the quality of the scan is proportional to the time spent in the scanner and in black-hole imaging, we can only access lossy measurements. Contrary to high-quality data, noisy samples are generally more accessible. If we had a method to transform noisy points into clean ones, e.g., by sampling from the posterior, we could address these challenges. A standard approach would be to use a pre-trained generative model as a prior. But how can we train these priors in the first place without having access to data? We show that one can escape this chicken-egg problem using diffusion-based algorithms that account for the corruption at training time. We present the first algorithm that provably recovers the distribution given only noisy samples of a fixed variance. We extend our algorithm to account for heterogeneous data where each training sample has a different noise level. The underlying mathematical tools can be generalized to linear measurements with the potential of accelerating MRI. Our method has deep connections to the literature on learning supervised models from corrupted data, such as SURE and Noise2X. Our framework opens exciting possibilities for generative modeling in data-constrained scientific applications. We are actively working on applying this to denoise proteins and we present some first results in this direction."

In this talk we will explore how to build algorithms that can uncover interpretable structure from large collections of unsupervised data like images and video. First, I will describe how to classify every pixel of a collection of images without any human annotations (Unsupervised semantic segmentation) by distilling self-supervised vision models. Second, we’ll see how this basic idea leads us to a new unifying theory of representation learning, and I will show how 20 different common machine learning methods such as dimensionality reduction, clustering, contrastive learning, and spectral methods emerge from a single unified equation. Finally, we’ll use this unified theory to create algorithms that can decode natural language just by watching unlabeled videos of people talking, without any knowledge of text. This work is the first step in our broader effort to translate animals using large scale, unsupervised, and interpretable learners, and the talk will conclude with some of our most recent efforts to analyze the complex vocalizations of Atlantic spotted dolphins."

This talk explores the relationship between equivariance, model calibration, and model confidence. In particular, we discuss bounds on calibration error for functions that are arbitrarily expressive except that they are constrained to be equivariant with respect to a group G. Following this, we discuss experiments related to Astrophysics and beyond that explore how these bounds manifest in practice."

The extraction of compact representations from these data helps identify meaningful patterns and understand their physical meaning. This talk focuses on three works that use deep learning and complex networks to achieve these goals. The first work shows how autoencoders can compress X-ray spectra into a low-dimensional latent space while preserving physical information. The second work shows that light curves can be aligned with textual summaries using contrastive learning. This alignment generates a shared compact multimodal representation of both modalities. Finally, the third work shows that complex networks can capture patterns in multimodal data, revealing anomalies (such as rare astrophysical sources)."

At its core, SMT estimates the score of mixture distributions between real and fake samples across multiple noise levels. Similar to consistency models, our approach supports both training from scratch (SMT) and distillation using a pretrained diffusion model, which we call Score-of-Mixture Distillation (SMD). It is simple to implement, requires minimal hyperparameter tuning, and ensures stable training. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet 64×64 show that SMT/SMD are competitive with and can even outperform existing methods. <br>Refreshments (tea and pastry) will be served."

Building upon previous work by Fanaroff and Riley, who classified relativistic jets in radio galaxies on kiloparsec scales, we extend this classification to parsec scales, closer to the central supermassive black hole. This approach enables detailed study of jet spatial structures and can help enhance accuracy in global positioning systems. We define four morphological classes: single Gaussian source, double Gaussian source, and sources with single or double-sided jets. Synthetic models of AGN jets were generated to create a training dataset for a convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN was trained on these synthetic data and subsequently applied to classify 130 thousand AGN jet images from the Astrogeo database. The distribution of images into designated classes, predicted by CNN, qualitatively matches the expected outcome."

In this talk, I will present two of our group's recent works studying AI's ability to 1) compositionally generalize and 2) learn new tasks at inference time. We demonstrate two phenomena: 'Hidden Emergence', where models robustly acquire a capability without actively using them and 'In-Context Learning of Representations', where models restructure their internal representations depending on the task given solely at test time. I will conclude by talking about the new frontier of 'reasoning' abilities of large language models, with interesting examples."

  event-details: "Hannes Stärk and Bowen Jing, Generative Models for Biomolecular Prediction, Dynamics, and Design: We lay out the three avenues in which we think generative models are especially valuable for modeling biomolecules. 1) Hard prediction tasks can be better addressed with generative models that can suggest and rank multiple solutions (e.g. docking). 2) The dynamics and conformations of biomolecules can be captured with generative models (e.g. protein conformational ensembles and MD trajectories). 3) Designing new biomolecules can be accelerated, informed by samples or likelihoods from generative models (e.g. protein binder or regulatory DNA design). Refreshments (tea and pastry) will be served."
