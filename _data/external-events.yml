  event-details: "The speaker will be Core Francisco Park, who will talk about: Understanding fundamental abilities of AI with synthetic experiments.<br><br>Abstract: Generative AI has shown impressive capabilities in both vision and language domains. However, despite the quickly growing practicality of AI models, our understanding of their fundamental abilities are limited. In this talk, I will present two of our group's recent works studying AI's ability to 1) compositionally generalize and 2) learn new tasks at inference time. We demonstrate two phenomena: 'Hidden Emergence', where models robustly acquire a capability without actively using them and 'In-Context Learning of Representations', where models restructure their internal representations depending on the task given solely at test time. I will conclude by talking about the new frontier of 'reasoning' abilities of large language models, with interesting examples."
