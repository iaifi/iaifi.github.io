  event-details: "Giannis Daras, Learning Generative Models from Corrupted Data.<br>Abstract: In scientific applications, generative models are used to regularize solutions to inverse problems. The quality of the models depends on the quality of the data on which they are trained. While natural images are abundant, in scientific applications access to high-quality data is scarce, expensive, or even impossible. For example, in MRI the quality of the scan is proportional to the time spent in the scanner and in black-hole imaging, we can only access lossy measurements. Contrary to high-quality data, noisy samples are generally more accessible. If we had a method to transform noisy points into clean ones, e.g., by sampling from the posterior, we could address these challenges. A standard approach would be to use a pre-trained generative model as a prior. But how can we train these priors in the first place without having access to data? We show that one can escape this chicken-egg problem using diffusion-based algorithms that account for the corruption at training time. We present the first algorithm that provably recovers the distribution given only noisy samples of a fixed variance. We extend our algorithm to account for heterogeneous data where each training sample has a different noise level. The underlying mathematical tools can be generalized to linear measurements with the potential of accelerating MRI. Our method has deep connections to the literature on learning supervised models from corrupted data, such as SURE and Noise2X. Our framework opens exciting possibilities for generative modeling in data-constrained scientific applications. We are actively working on applying this to denoise proteins and we present some first results in this direction."

This talk explores the relationship between equivariance, model calibration, and model confidence. In particular, we discuss bounds on calibration error for functions that are arbitrarily expressive except that they are constrained to be equivariant with respect to a group G. Following this, we discuss experiments related to Astrophysics and beyond that explore how these bounds manifest in practice."

The extraction of compact representations from these data helps identify meaningful patterns and understand their physical meaning. This talk focuses on three works that use deep learning and complex networks to achieve these goals. The first work shows how autoencoders can compress X-ray spectra into a low-dimensional latent space while preserving physical information. The second work shows that light curves can be aligned with textual summaries using contrastive learning. This alignment generates a shared compact multimodal representation of both modalities. Finally, the third work shows that complex networks can capture patterns in multimodal data, revealing anomalies (such as rare astrophysical sources)."

At its core, SMT estimates the score of mixture distributions between real and fake samples across multiple noise levels. Similar to consistency models, our approach supports both training from scratch (SMT) and distillation using a pretrained diffusion model, which we call Score-of-Mixture Distillation (SMD). It is simple to implement, requires minimal hyperparameter tuning, and ensures stable training. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet 64√ó64 show that SMT/SMD are competitive with and can even outperform existing methods. <br>Refreshments (tea and pastry) will be served."

Building upon previous work by Fanaroff and Riley, who classified relativistic jets in radio galaxies on kiloparsec scales, we extend this classification to parsec scales, closer to the central supermassive black hole. This approach enables detailed study of jet spatial structures and can help enhance accuracy in global positioning systems. We define four morphological classes: single Gaussian source, double Gaussian source, and sources with single or double-sided jets. Synthetic models of AGN jets were generated to create a training dataset for a convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN was trained on these synthetic data and subsequently applied to classify 130 thousand AGN jet images from the Astrogeo database. The distribution of images into designated classes, predicted by CNN, qualitatively matches the expected outcome."

However, despite the quickly growing practicality of AI models, our understanding of their fundamental abilities are limited. In this talk, I will present two of our group's recent works studying AI's ability to 1) compositionally generalize and 2) learn new tasks at inference time. We demonstrate two phenomena: 'Hidden Emergence', where models robustly acquire a capability without actively using them and 'In-Context Learning of Representations', where models restructure their internal representations depending on the task given solely at test time. I will conclude by talking about the new frontier of 'reasoning' abilities of large language models, with interesting examples."

  event-details: "Hannes St√§rk and Bowen Jing, Generative Models for Biomolecular Prediction, Dynamics, and Design: We lay out the three avenues in which we think generative models are especially valuable for modeling biomolecules. 1) Hard prediction tasks can be better addressed with generative models that can suggest and rank multiple solutions (e.g. docking). 2) The dynamics and conformations of biomolecules can be captured with generative models (e.g. protein conformational ensembles and MD trajectories). 3) Designing new biomolecules can be accelerated, informed by samples or likelihoods from generative models (e.g. protein binder or regulatory DNA design). Refreshments (tea and pastry) will be served."
