The company is in the business of selling materials and equipment for the electronics industry (predominantly chemistry for chipmakers) and his Digital Solutions organization deploys data science in our production plants, supply chains, R&D, and commercial teams. They are a team of 35+ talented scientists and engineers that work very closely with the frontline business. The work stretches many things such as data engineering, data science, MLOps, or project management."
