His PhD focused on new adaptive integrators for stochastic differential equations, combining ideas from numerical analysis and machine learning. Collaborating with Extropic during this time, he helped improve their simulation software and later took on a more machine learning oriented role. He now leads ML algorithm research at Extropic together with CTO Trevor McCourt."

  talk-abstract: "This session focuses on what makes for a good advisor/mentor, and how you can use self-assessment tools (e.g. the 'Happiness Questionnaire') to evaluate your work relationships. Based on that we will discuss how to identify and address issues early on, and how you can build a supportive network ('your village'). Finally, thinking about your own career expectations and being proactive about it is the key to finding and working with a great mentor. There will be interactive activities such as worksheets and table discussions during the session."
