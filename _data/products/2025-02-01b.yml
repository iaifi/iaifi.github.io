abstract: "Normalizing flows have arisen as a tool to accelerate Monte Carlo sampling for lattice field theories. This work reviews recent progress in applying normalizing flows to 4-dimensional nonabelian gauge theories, focusing on two advancements: an architectural improvement referred to as learned active loops, and the application of correlated ensemble methods to QCD with Nf=2 dynamical fermions."
