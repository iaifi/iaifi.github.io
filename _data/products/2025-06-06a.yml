abstract: "We present extensive ultraviolet (UV), optical, and near-infrared (NIR) photometric and spectroscopic observations of the nearby hydrogen-poor superluminous supernova (SLSN-I) SN2024rmj at z = 0.1189. SN 2024rmj reached a peak absolute magnitude of Mg ≈ -21.9, placing it at the luminous end of the SLSN-I distribution. The light curve exhibits a pronounced pre-peak bump (≈ 60 d before the main peak) and a post-peak bump (≈ 55 d after the main peak). The bulk of the light curve is otherwise well fit by a magnetar spin-down model, with typical values (spin: ≈ 2.1 ms; magnetic field: ≈ 6 × 1013 G; ejecta mass: ≈ 12 M⊙). The optical spectra exhibit characteristic SLSN-I features and evolution, but with a relatively high velocity of ≈ 8,000 km s−1 post-peak. Most significantly, we find a clear detection of helium in the NIR spectra at He I λ1.083 μm and λ2.058 μm, blueshifted by ≈ 15,000 km s−1 (13 d before peak) and ≈ 13,000 km s−1 (40 d after peak), indicating that helium is confined to the outermost ejecta; based on these NIR detections, we also identify likely contribution from He I λ5876 Å in the optical spectra on a similar range of timescales. This represents the most definitive detection of helium in a bright SLSN-I to date, and indicates that progenitors with a thin helium layer can still explode as SLSNe."
