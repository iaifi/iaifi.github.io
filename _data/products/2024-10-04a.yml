abstract: "Lattice gauge fixing is required to compute gauge-variant quantities, for example those used in RI-MOM renormalization schemes or as objects of comparison for model calculations. Recently, gauge-variant quantities have also been found to be more amenable to signal-to-noise optimization using contour deformations. These applications motivate systematic parameterization and exploration of gauge-fixing schemes. This work introduces a differentiable parameterization of gauge fixing which is broad enough to cover Landau gauge, Coulomb gauge, and maximal tree gauges. The adjoint state method allows gradient-based optimization to select gauge-fixing schemes that minimize an arbitrary target loss function."
