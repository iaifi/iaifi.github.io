title: "AI Poincaré: Machine Learning Conservation Laws from Trajectories"
authors: Ziming Liu and Max Tegmark
abstract: We present AI Poincaré, a machine learning algorithm for auto-discovering conserved quantities using trajectory data from unknown dynamical systems. We test it on five Hamiltonian systems, including the gravitational 3-body problem, and find that it discovers not only all exactly conserved quantities, but also periodic orbits, phase transitions and breakdown timescales for approximate conservation laws.
