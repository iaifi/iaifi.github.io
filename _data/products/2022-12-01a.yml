abstract: "Physicists dating back to Feynman have lamented the difficulties of applying the variational principle to quantum field theories. In non-relativistic quantum field theories, the challenge is to parameterize and optimize over the infinitely many n-particle wave functions comprising the state's Fock space representation. Here we approach this problem by introducing neural-network quantum field states, a deep learning ansatz that enables application of the variational principle to non-relativistic quantum field theories in the continuum. Our ansatz uses the Deep Sets neural network architecture to simultaneously parameterize all of the n-particle wave functions comprising a quantum field state. We employ our ansatz to approximate ground states of various field theories, including an inhomogeneous system and a system with long-range interactions, thus demonstrating a powerful new tool for probing quantum field theories."
