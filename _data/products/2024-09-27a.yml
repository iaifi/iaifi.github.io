abstract: "We study TT¯-like deformations of d>2 Yang-Mills theories. The standard TT¯ flows lead to multi-trace Lagrangians, and the non-Abelian gauge structures make it challenging to find Lagrangians in a closed form. However, within the geometric approach to TT¯, we obtain the closed-form solution to the metric flow and stress-energy tensor, and show that instanton solutions are undeformed. We also introduce new symmetrised single-trace TT¯-like deformations, whose solutions in d=4 include the non-Abelian Born-Infeld Lagrangian proposed by Tseytlin in 1997."
