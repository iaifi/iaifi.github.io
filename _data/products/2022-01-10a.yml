abstract: "A strictification result is proved for isotropic distributions on derived schemes equipped with negatively shifted homotopically closed 2-forms. It is shown that any derived scheme over ℂ equipped with a −2-shifted symplectic structure, and having a Hausdorff space of classical points, admits a globally defined Lagrangian distribution as a dg ℂ∞-manifold."
