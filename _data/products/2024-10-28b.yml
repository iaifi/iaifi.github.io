abstract: "In this article we study a relative monoidal version of the Bondal-Orlov reconstruction theorem. We establish an uniqueness result for tensor triangulated category structures (⊠,𝟙) on the derived category Db(X) of a variety X which is smooth projective and faithfully flat over a quasi-compact quasi-separated base scheme S in the case where the fibers Xs over any point s∈S all have ample (anti-)canonical bundles. To do so we construct a stack Γ of dg-bifunctors which parametrize the local homotopical behaviour of ⊠, and we study some of its properties around the derived categories of the fibers Xs."
