title: "Holography with Null Boundaries"
authors: "Christian Ferko, Savdeep Sethi"
abstract: "One of the key issues in holography is going beyond AdS and defining quantum gravity in spacetimes with a null boundary. Recent examples of this type involve linear dilaton asymptotics and are related to the TT deformation. We present a holographic correspondence derived from string theory, which is an example of a kind of celestial holography. The holographic definition is a spacetime non-commutative open string theory supported on D1-D5 branes together with fundamental strings. The gravity solutions interpolate between AdS3 metrics and six-dimensional metrics. Radiation can escape to null infinity, which makes both the encoding of quantum information in the boundary and the dynamics of black holes quite different from AdS spacetimes."
