abstract: "We present a comprehensive analysis of the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of SN~2021foa, unique among the class of transitional supernovae for repeatedly changing its spectroscopic appearance from hydrogen-to-helium-to-hydrogen-dominated (IIn-to-Ibn-to-IIn) within 50 days past peak brightness. The spectra exhibit multiple narrow (≈ 300--600~km~s−1) absorption lines of hydrogen, helium, calcium and iron together with broad helium emission lines with a full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of ∼6000~km~s−1. For a steady, wind-mass loss regime, light curve modeling results in an ejecta mass of ∼8 M⊙ and CSM mass below 1 M⊙, and an ejecta velocity consistent with the FWHM of the broad helium lines. We obtain a mass-loss rate of ≈2 M⊙yr−1. This mass-loss rate is three orders of magnitude larger than derived for normal Type II SNe. We estimate that the bulk of the CSM of SN~2021foa must have been expelled within half a year, about 15 years ago. Our analysis suggests that SN~2021foa had a helium rich ejecta which swept up a dense shell of hydrogen rich CSM shortly after explosion. At about 60 days past peak brightness, the photosphere recedes through the dense ejecta-CSM region, occulting much of the red-shifted emission of the hydrogen and helium lines, which results in observed blue-shift (∼−3000~km~s−1). Strong mass loss activity prior to explosion, such as those seen in SN~2009ip-like objects and SN~2021foa as precursor emission, are the likely origin of a complex, multiple-shell CSM close to the progenitor star."
