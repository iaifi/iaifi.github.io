abstract: 'We present an efficient approach to set informative physically motivated priors for EFT-based full-shape analyses of galaxy survey data. We extract these priors from simulated galaxy catalogs based on halo occupation distribution (HOD) models. As a first step, we build a joint distribution between EFT galaxy bias and HOD parameters from a set of 10,500 HOD mock catalogs. We make use of the field level EFT technique that allows for cosmic variance cancellation, enabling a precision calibration of EFT parameters from computationally inexpensive small-volume simulations. As a second step, we use neural density estimators -- normalizing flows -- to model the marginal probability density of the EFT parameters, which can be used as a prior distribution in full shape analyses. As a first application, we use our HOD-based prior distribution in a new analysis of galaxy power spectra and bispectra from the BOSS survey in the context of single field primordial non-Gaussianity. We find that our approach leads to a reduction of the posterior volume of bias parameters by an order of magnitude. We also find fequilNL=650±310 and forthoNL=42±130 (at 68\% CL) in a combined two-template analysis, representing a ≈40% improvement in constraints on single field primordial non-Gaussianity, equivalent to doubling the survey volume.'
