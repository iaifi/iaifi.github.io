abstract: "The unfolding of detector effects in experimental data is critical for enabling precision measurements in high-energy physics. However, traditional unfolding methods face challenges in scalability, flexibility, and dependence on simulations. We introduce a novel unfolding approach using conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (cDDPM). Our method utilizes the cDDPM for a non-iterative, flexible posterior sampling approach, which exhibits a strong inductive bias that allows it to generalize to unseen physics processes without explicitly assuming the underlying distribution. We test our approach by training a single cDDPM to perform multidimensional particle-wise unfolding for a variety of physics processes, including those not seen during training. Our results highlight the potential of this method as a step towards a 'universal' unfolding tool that reduces dependence on truth-level assumptions."
