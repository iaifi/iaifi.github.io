abstract: "Quasars are bright active galactic nuclei powered by the accretion of matter around supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies. Their stochastic brightness variability depends on the physical properties of the accretion disk and black hole. The upcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to observe tens of millions of quasars, so there is a need for efficient techniques like machine learning that can handle the large volume of data. Quasar variability is believed to be driven by an X-ray corona, which is reprocessed by the accretion disk and emitted as UV/optical variability. We are the first to introduce an auto-differentiable simulation of the accretion disk and reprocessing. We use the simulation as a direct component of our neural network to jointly model the driving variability and reprocessing to fit simulated LSST 10-year quasar light curves. The driving variability is reconstructed using a latent stochastic differential equation, a physically motivated, generative deep learning method that can model continuous-time stochastic dynamics. By embedding these physical processes into our network, we achieve a model that is more robust and interpretable. We also use transformers to scale our model to tens of millions of parameters. We demonstrate how our model outperforms a Gaussian process regression baseline and can infer accretion disk parameters and time delays between wavebands, even for out-of-distribution driving signals. Our approach provides a powerful and scalable framework that can be adapted to solve other inverse problems in multivariate time series with irregular sampling."
