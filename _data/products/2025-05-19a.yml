abstract: "The commuting scheme ℭd𝔤 for reductive Lie algebra 𝔤 over an algebraically closed field 𝕂 is the subscheme of 𝔤d defined by quadratic equations, whose 𝕂-valued points are d-tuples of commuting elements in 𝔤 over 𝕂. There is a long-standing conjecture that the commuting scheme ℭd𝔤 is reduced. Moreover, a higher dimensional analog of Chevalley restriction conjecture was conjectured by Chen-Ngô. We show that the commuting scheme of ℭ2𝔤ln is Cohen-Macaulay and normal. As a corollary, we prove a 2-dimensional Chevalley restriction theorem for general linear group in positive characteristic."
