abstract: "The ℂℙN−1 model is an analytically tractable 2d quantum field theory which shares several properties with 4d Yang-Mills theory. By virtue of its classical integrability, this model also admits a family of integrable higher-spin auxiliary field deformations, including the TT deformation as a special case. We study the ℂℙN−1 model and its deformations from a geometrical perspective, constructing their soliton surfaces and recasting physical properties of these theories as statements about surface geometry. We examine how the TT flow affects the unit constraint in the ℂℙN−1 model and prove that any solution of this theory with vanishing energy-momentum tensor remains a solution under analytic stress tensor deformations -- an argument that extends to generic dimensions and instanton-like solutions in stress tensor flows including the non-analytic, 2d, root-TT case and classes of higher-spin, Smirnov-Zamolodchikov-type, deformations. Finally, we give two geometric interpretations for general TT-like deformations of symmetric space sigma models, showing that such flows can be viewed as coupling the undeformed theory to a unit-determinant field-dependent metric, or using a particular choice of moving frame on the soliton surface."
