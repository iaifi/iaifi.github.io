title: "Shifted symplectic structures on derived Quot-stacks II -- Derived Quot-schemes as dg manifolds"
authors: "Dennis Borisov, Ludmil Katzarkov, Artan Sheshmani"
abstract: "It is proved that derived Quot-schemes, as defined by Ciocan-Fontanine and Kapranov, are represented by dg manifolds of finite type. This is the second part if a work aimed to analyze shifted symplectic structures on moduli spaces of coherent sheaves on Calabi--Yau manifolds. The first part related dg manifolds to derived schemes as defined by Toën and Vezzosi."
