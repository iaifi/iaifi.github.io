title: "Tropical super Gromov-Witten invariants"
authors: "Artan Sheshmani, Shing-Tung Yau, Benjamin Zhou"
abstract: "We show that super Gromov-Witten invariants can be defined and computed by methods of tropical geometry. When the target is a point, the super invariants are descendant invariants on the moduli space of curves, which can be computed tropically. When the target is a convex, toric variety X, we describe a procedure to compute the tropical Euler class of the SUSY normal bundle N_n,β on _0,n(X,β), assuming it is locally tropicalizable in the sense of [CG], [CGM]. Then, we define the tropical, genus-0, n-marked, super Gromov-Witten invariant of X, and compute an example. This gives a tropical interpretation of super Gromov-Witten invariants of convex, toric varieties."
