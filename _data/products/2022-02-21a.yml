abstract: "The pion light-cone distribution amplitude (LCDA) is a central non-perturbative object of interest for high-energy exclusive processes in quantum chromodynamics. In this article, the second Mellin moment of the pion LCDA is determined as a proof-of-concept calculation for the first numerical implementation of the heavy-quark operator product expansion (HOPE) method. The resulting value for the second Mellin moment, determined in quenched QCD at a pion mass of mπ=550 MeV at a factorization scale of 2 GeV is ⟨ξ2⟩=0.210±0.013 (stat.)±0.034 (sys.). This result is compatible with those from previous determinations of this quantity."
