abstract: 'Recent studies using four-point correlations suggest a parity violation in the galaxy distribution, though the significance of these detections is sensitive to the choice of simulation used to model the noise properties of the galaxy distribution. In a recent paper, we introduce an unsupervised learning approach which offers an alternative method that avoids the dependence on mock catalogs, by learning parity violation directly from observational data. However, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model utilized by our previous unsupervised approach struggles to extend to more realistic scenarios where data is limited. We propose a novel method, the Neural Field Scattering Transform (NFST), which enhances the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST) technique by adding trainable filters, parameterized as a neural field. We first tune the NFST model to detect parity violation in a simplified dataset, then compare its performance against WST and CNN benchmarks across varied training set sizes. We find the NFST can detect parity violation with 4× less data than the CNN and 32× less than the WST. Furthermore, in cases with limited data the NFST can detect parity violation with up to 6σ confidence, where the WST and CNN fail to make any detection. We identify that the added flexibility of the NFST, and particularly the ability to learn asymmetric filters, as well as the specific symmetries built into the NFST architecture, contribute to its improved performance over the benchmark models. We further demonstrate that the NFST is readily interpretable, which is valuable for physical applications such as the detection of parity violation.'
