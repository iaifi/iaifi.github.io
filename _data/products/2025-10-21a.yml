abstract: "We present an approach to solving the ground state of Fermi systems that contain spin or other discrete degrees of freedom in addition to continuous coordinates. The approach combines a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling for energy estimation that we adapted to cover the extended configuration space with a transformer-based wavefunction to represent fermionic states. This sampling is necessary when the Hamiltonian contains explicit spin dependence and, for spin-independent Hamiltonians, we find that the inclusion of spin updates leads to faster convergence to an antiferromagnetic ground state. A transformer with both continuous position and discrete spin as inputs achieves universal approximation to spinful generalized orbitals. We validate the method on a range of two-dimensional material problems: a two-dimensional electron gas with Rashba spin-orbit coupling, a noncollinear spin texture, and a quantum antiferromagnet in a honeycomb moiré potential."
