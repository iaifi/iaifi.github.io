abstract: "Jets of hadrons produced at high-energy colliders provide experimental access to the dynamics of asymptotically free quarks and gluons and their confinement into hadrons. In this paper, we show that the high energies of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), together with the exceptional resolution of its detectors, allow multipoint correlation functions of energy flow operators to be directly measured within jets for the first time. Using Open Data from the CMS experiment, we show that reformulating jet substructure in terms of these correlators provides new ways of probing the dynamics of QCD jets, which enables direct imaging of the confining transition to free hadrons as well as precision measurements of the scaling properties and interactions of quarks and gluons. This opens a new era in our understanding of jet substructure and illustrates the immense unexploited potential of high-quality LHC data sets for elucidating the dynamics of QCD."
