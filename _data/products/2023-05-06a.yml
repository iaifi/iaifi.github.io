abstract: 'The high-energy physics community is investigating the feasibility of deploying machine-learning-based solutions on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) to improve physics sensitivity while meeting data processing latency limitations. In this contribution, we introduce a novel end-to-end procedure that utilizes a machine learning technique called symbolic regression (SR). It searches equation space to discover algebraic relations approximating a dataset. We use PySR (software for uncovering these expressions based on evolutionary algorithm) and extend the functionality of hls4ml (a package for machine learning inference in FPGAs) to support PySR-generated expressions for resource-constrained production environments. Deep learning models often optimise the top metric by pinning the network size because vast hyperparameter space prevents extensive neural architecture search. Conversely, SR selects a set of models on the Pareto front, which allows for optimising the performance-resource tradeoff directly. By embedding symbolic forms, our implementation can dramatically reduce the computational resources needed to perform critical tasks. We validate our procedure on a physics benchmark: multiclass classification of jets produced in simulated proton-proton collisions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider, and show that we approximate a 3-layer neural network with an inference model that has as low as 5 ns execution time (a reduction by a factor of 13) and over 90% approximation accuracy.'
