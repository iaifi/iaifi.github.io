abstract: "In this paper, we study the vanishing order of rational L-functions from a data scientific perspective. Each L-function is represented in our data by finitely many Dirichlet coefficients, the normalisation of which depends on the context. We observe murmuration-like patterns in averages across our dataset, find that PCA clusters rational L-functions by their vanishing order, and record that LDA and neural networks may accurately predict this quantity."
