abstract: We present optical photometry and spectroscopy of SN\,2019stc (=ZTF19acbonaa), an unusual Type Ic supernova (SN Ic) at a redshift of z=0.117. SN\,2019stc exhibits a broad double-peaked light curve, with the first peak having an absolute magnitude of Mr=−20.0 mag, and the second peak, about 80 rest-frame days later, Mr=−19.2 mag. The total radiated energy is large, Erad≈2.5×1050 erg. Despite its large luminosity, approaching those of Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), SN\,2019stc exhibits a typical SN Ic spectrum, bridging the gap between SLSNe and SNe Ic. The spectra indicate the presence of Fe-peak elements, but modeling of the first light curve peak with radioactive heating alone leads to an unusually high nickel mass fraction of fNi≈31% (MNi≈3.2 M⊙). Instead, if we model the first peak with a combined magnetar spin-down and radioactive heating model we find a better match with Mej≈4 M⊙, a magnetar spin period of Pspin≈7.2 ms and magnetic field of B≈1014 G, and fNi≲0.2 (consistent with SNe Ic). The prominent second peak cannot be naturally accommodated with radioactive heating or magnetar spin-down, but instead can be explained as circumstellar interaction with ≈0.7 M⊙ of hydrogen-free material located ≈400 AU from the progenitor. Including the remnant mass leads to a CO core mass prior to explosion of ≈6.5 M⊙. The host galaxy has a metallicity of ≈0.26 Z⊙, low for SNe Ic but consistent with SLSNe. Overall, we find that SN\,2019stc is a transition object between normal SNe Ic and SLSNe.
