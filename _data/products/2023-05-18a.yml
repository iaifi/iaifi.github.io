abstract: 'We present optical photometry and spectroscopy of the Type IIn supernova (SN) 2021qqp. Its unusual light curve is marked by a long precursor for ≈300 days, a rapid increase in brightness for ≈60 days, and then a sharp increase of ≈1.6 mag in only a few days to a first peak of Mr≈−19.5 mag. The light curve then declines rapidly until it re-brightens to a second distinct peak of Mr≈−17.3 mag centered at ≈335 days after the first peak. The spectra are dominated by Balmer lines with a complex morphology, including a narrow component with a width of ≈1300 km s−1 (first peak) and ≈2500 km s−1 (second peak) that we associate with the circumstellar medium (CSM) and a P Cygni component with an absorption velocity of ≈8500 km s−1 (first peak) and ≈5600 km s−1 (second peak) that we associate with the SN-CSM interaction shell. Using the luminosity and velocity evolution, we construct a flexible analytical model, finding two significant mass-loss episodes with peak mass loss rates of ≈10 and ≈5M⊙ yr−1 about 0.8 and 2 yr before explosion, respectively, with a total CSM mass of ≈2−4M⊙. We show that the most recent mass-loss episode could explain the precursor for the year preceding the explosion. The SN ejecta mass is constrained to be ≈5−30M⊙ for an explosion energy of ≈(3−10)×1051 erg. We discuss eruptive massive stars (luminous blue variable, pulsational pair instability) and an extreme stellar merger with a compact object as possible progenitor channels.'
