abstract: "We consider the problem of reconstructing a H×W×31 hyperspectral image from a H×W grayscale snapshot measurement that is captured using a single diffractive optic and a filterless panchromatic photosensor. This problem is severely ill-posed, and we present the first model that is able to produce high-quality results. We train a conditional denoising diffusion model that maps a small grayscale measurement patch to a hyperspectral patch. We then deploy the model to many patches in parallel, using global physics-based guidance to synchronize the patch predictions. Our model can be trained using small hyperspectral datasets and then deployed to reconstruct hyperspectral images of arbitrary size. Also, by drawing multiple samples with different seeds, our model produces useful uncertainty maps. We show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on previous snapshot hyperspectral benchmarks where reconstruction is better conditioned. Our work lays the foundation for a new class of high-resolution hyperspectral imagers that are compact and light-efficient."
