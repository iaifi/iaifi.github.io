abstract: "Recent advances on neural quantum states have shown that correlations between quantum particles can be efficiently captured by <i>'attention'</i> -- a foundation of modern neural architectures that enables neural networks to learn the relation between objects. In this work, we show that a general-purpose self-attention Fermi neural network is able to find chiral px±ipy superconductivity in an attractive Fermi gas by energy minimization, <i>without prior knowledge or bias towards pairing</i>. The superconducting state is identified from the optimized wavefunction by measuring various physical observables: the pair binding energy, the total angular momentum of the ground state, and off-diagonal long-range order in the two-body reduced density matrix. Our work paves the way for AI-driven discovery of unconventional and topological superconductivity in strongly correlated quantum materials."
