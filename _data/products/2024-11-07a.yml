abstract: "This document summarizes the discussions which took place during the PITT-PACC Workshop entitled 'Non-Standard Cosmological Epochs and Expansion Histories,' held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Sept. 5-7, 2024. Much like the non-standard cosmological epochs that were the subject of these discussions, the format of this workshop was also non-standard. Rather than consisting of a series of talks from participants, with each person presenting their own work, this workshop was instead organized around free-form discussion blocks, with each centered on a different overall theme and guided by a different set of Discussion Leaders. This document is not intended to serve as a comprehensive review of these topics, but rather as an informal record of the discussions that took place during the workshop, in the hope that the content and free-flowing spirit of these discussions may inspire new ideas and research directions."
