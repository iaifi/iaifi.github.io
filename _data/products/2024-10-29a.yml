abstract: "In this paper, we study the multi-rigidity problem in rational homogeneous spaces. A Schubert class is called multi-rigid if every multiple of it can only be represented by a union of Schubert varieties. We prove the multi-rigidity of Schubert classes in rational homogeneous spaces. In particular, we characterize the multi-rigid Schubert classes in partial flag varieties of type A, B and D. Moreover, for a general rational homogeneous space G/P, we deduce the rigidity and multi-rigidity from the corresponding generalized Grassmannians (correspond to maximal parabolics). When G is semi-simple, we also deduce the rigidity and multi-rigidity from the simple cases."
