title: Poisson Flow Generative Models
authors: Yilun Xu, Ziming Liu, Max Tegmark, Tommi Jaakkola
abstract: 'We propose a new "Poisson flow" generative model (PFGM) that maps a uniform distribution on a high-dimensional hemisphere into any data distribution. We interpret the data points as electrical charges on the z=0 hyperplane in a space augmented with an additional dimension z, generating a high-dimensional electric field (the gradient of the solution to Poisson equation). We prove that if these charges flow upward along electric field lines, their initial distribution in the z=0 plane transforms into a distribution on the hemisphere of radius r that becomes uniform in the r→∞ limit. To learn the bijective transformation, we estimate the normalized field in the augmented space. For sampling, we devise a backward ODE that is anchored by the physically meaningful additional dimension: the samples hit the unaugmented data manifold when the z reaches zero. Experimentally, PFGM achieves current state-of-the-art performance among the normalizing flow models on CIFAR-10, with an Inception score of 9.68 and a FID score of 2.48. It also performs on par with the state-of-the-art SDE approaches while offering 10× to 20× acceleration on image generation tasks. Additionally, PFGM appears more tolerant of estimation errors on a weaker network architecture and robust to the step size in the Euler method.'
