abstract: "In this work, we study how the abundance and dynamics of populations of disrupting satellite galaxies change systematically as a function of host galaxy properties. We apply a theoretical model of the phase-mixing process to classify intact satellite galaxies, stellar stream-like and shell-like debris in ~1500 Milky Way-mass systems generated by a semi-analytic galaxy formation code, SatGen. In particular, we test the effect of host galaxy halo mass, disk mass, ratio of disk scale height to length, and stellar feedback model on disrupting satellite populations. We find that the counts of tidal debris are consistent across all host galaxy models, within a given host mass range, and that all models can have stream-like debris on low-energy orbits, consistent with those observed around the Milky Way. However, we find a preference for stream-like debris on lower-energy orbits in models with a thicker (lower-density) host disk or on higher-energy orbits in models with a more-massive host disk. Importantly, we observe significant halo-to-halo variance across all models. These results highlight the importance of simulating and observing large samples of Milky Way-mass galaxies and accounting for variations in host properties when using disrupting satellites in studies of near-field cosmology."
