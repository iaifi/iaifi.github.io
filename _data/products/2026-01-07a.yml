title: "A glimpse into the Ultrametric spectrum"

abstract: "The non-relativistic string spectrum is built from integer-spaced energy quanta in such a way that the high-temperature asymptotics, via the Hardy-Ramanujan formula for integer partitions, reduces to standard two-dimensional thermodynamics. Here we explore deformed realizations of this behavior motivated by p-adic string theory and Lorentzian versions thereof with a non-trivial spectrum. We study the microstate scaling that results on associating quantum harmonic oscillators to the normal modes of tree-graphs rather than string graphs and observe that Hardy-Ramanujan scaling is not realized. But by computing the eigenvalues of the derivative operator on the p-adic circle and by determining the eigenspectrum of the Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator, we uncover a spectrum of exponentially growing energies but with exponentially growing degeneracies balanced in such a way that Hardy-Ramanujan scaling is realized, but modulated with log-periodic fluctuations."
