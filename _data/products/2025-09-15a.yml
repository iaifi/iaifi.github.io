abstract: "Hydrogen-rich supernovae (SNe) span a range of hydrogen envelope masses at core collapse, producing diverse light curves from extended plateaus in Type II SNe to double-peaked Type IIb SNe. Recent hydrodynamic modeling predicts a continuous sequence of light-curve morphologies as hydrogen is removed, with short plateau SNe (plateau durations ~50--70 days) emerging as a transitional class. However, the observational boundary between IIb and short-plateau remains poorly defined, and thus far unobserved. We report on extensive photometric and spectroscopic follow-up of SN 2023wdd and SN 2022acrv, candidate transitional events on the low-mass end of the short-plateau class. Both exhibit weak, double-peaked light curves which we interpret as exceptionally short plateaus (10--20 days), and hybrid spectral features: persistent H absorption with He I contamination, but without the helium dominance characteristic of IIb SNe. Using analytic shock-cooling models and numerical light curve fitting, we estimate hydrogen-rich envelope masses of ~0.6--0.8  -- significantly larger than canonical IIb values () but consistent with the  threshold predicted for short-plateau behavior. Although the progenitor radii inferred from analytic and numerical methods differ by factors of 2--5, envelope mass estimates are consistent across approaches. Comparisons to well-studied IIb (SN 2016gkg, SN 2022hnt), short-plateau (SN 2023ufx, SN 2006ai, SN 2016egz, SN 2006Y), and II SNe (SN 2023ixf, SN 2013ej) suggest a monotonic relationship between hydrogen envelope mass and plateau length consistent with analytic and numerical expectations. These findings provide additional evidence for a continuous distribution of envelope stripping in hydrogen-rich core-collapse progenitors and place SN 2023wdd and SN 2022acrv along the IIb/short-plateau boundary."
