title: "Remove Symmetries to Control Model Expressivity"

abstract: 'When symmetry is present in the loss function, the model is likely to be trapped in a low-capacity state that is sometimes known as a "collapse." Being trapped in these low-capacity states can be a major obstacle to training across many scenarios where deep learning technology is applied. We first prove two concrete mechanisms through which symmetries lead to reduced capacities and ignored features during training. We then propose a simple and theoretically justified algorithm, syre, to remove almost all symmetry-induced low-capacity states in neural networks. The proposed method is shown to improve the training of neural networks in scenarios when this type of entrapment is especially a concern. A remarkable merit of the proposed method is that it is model-agnostic and does not require any knowledge of the symmetry.'
