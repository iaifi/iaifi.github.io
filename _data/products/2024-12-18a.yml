abstract: "Muon colliders provide an exciting new path pushing forward the energy frontier of particle physics. We point out a new use of these facilities for neutrino physics and beyond the Standard Model physics using their main detectors. Muon decays along the main accelerator rings induce an intense, highly collimated beam of neutrinos. As this beam crosses a thin slice of the kt-scale detector, it would induce unprecedented numbers of neutrino interactions, with O(104) events per second for a 10 TeV µ+µ− collider. We characterize these events, showing that they are highly energetic and possess a distinct timing signature with a large transverse displacement. We discuss promising applications of these events for instrumentation, electroweak, and beyond-the-Standard Model physics. For instance, we show that a sub-percent measurement of the neutrino-electron scattering rate enables new precision measurements of the Weak angle and a novel detection of the neutrino charge radius."
