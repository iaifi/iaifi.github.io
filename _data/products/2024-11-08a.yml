abstract: "In this work, we significantly expand the web of T-dualities among heterotic NS5-brane theories with eight supercharges. This is achieved by introducing twists involving outer automorphisms of discrete gauge/flavor factors and tensor multiplet permutations along the compactification circle. We assemble field theory data that we propose as invariants across T-dual theories, comprised of twisted Coulomb branch dimensions, higher group structures and flavor symmetry ranks. Using this data, we establish a detailed field theory correspondence between singularities of the compactification space, the number five-branes in the theory, and the flavor symmetry factors. The twisted theories are realized via M-theory compactifications on non-compact genus-one fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds without section. This approach allows us to prove duality of twisted and (un-)twisted theories by leveraging M/F-theory duality and identifying inequivalent torus fibrations in the same geometry. We construct several new 5D theories, including a novel type of CHL-like twisted theory where the two M9 branes are identified. Using their field theory invariants, we also construct their dual theories."
