abstract: "We prove that any quantum field theory, or more generally any probability distribution over tempered distributions in ℝd, admits a neural network description with a countable infinity of parameters. As an example, we realize the 2d Liouville theory as a neural network and numerically compute the three-point function of vertex operators, finding agreement with the DOZZ formula."
