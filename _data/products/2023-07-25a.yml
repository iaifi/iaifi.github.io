abstract: We show for the first time, high-fidelity generation of LArTPC-like data using a generative neural network. This demonstrates that methods developed for natural images do transfer to LArTPC-produced images which in contrast to natural images are globally sparse, but locally dense. We present the method we employ, which is a variant of score-based generative diffusion models. We evaluate the fidelity of the generated images using several different approaches that include using a variant of measures used to evaluate natural images, comparisons between high-dimensional distributions, and comparisons relevant to LArTPC experiments.
