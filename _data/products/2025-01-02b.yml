abstract: "The high-redshift UV luminosity function provides important insights into the evolution of early galaxies. JWST has revealed an unexpectedly large population of bright (MUV≲−20) galaxies at z≳10, implying fundamental changes in the star forming properties of galaxies at increasingly early times. However, constraining the fainter population (MUV≳−18) has been more challenging. In this work, we present the z≳9 UV luminosity function from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey. We calculate the UV luminosity function from several hundred z≳9 galaxy candidates that reach UV luminosities of MUV∼−17 in redshift bins of z∼9−12 (309 candidates) and z∼12−16 (63 candidates). We search for candidates at z∼16−22.5 and find none. We also estimate the z∼14−16 luminosity function from the z≥14 subset of the z∼12−16 sample. Consistent with other measurements, we find an excess of bright galaxies that is in tension with many theoretical models, especially at z≳12. However, we also find high number densities at −18≲MUV≲−17, suggesting that there is a larger population of faint galaxies than expected, as well as bright ones. From our parametric fits for the luminosity function, we find steep faint end slopes of −2.5≲α≲−2.3, suggesting a large population of faint (MUV≳−17) galaxies. Combined, the high normalization and steep faint end slope of the luminosity function could imply that the reionization process is appreciably underway as early as z=10."
