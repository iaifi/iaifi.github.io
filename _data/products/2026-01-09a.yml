title: "String Theory from Infinite Width Neural Networks"
authors: "Samuel Frank, James Halverson"
abstract: "We realize bosonic string theory with ensembles of infinite width neural networks. The string tension is tuned by the variance of the output weights. The construction provides a new computation of the foundational Virasoro-Shapiro and Veneziano amplitudes as neural network correlators."
