abstract: "We present the first joint-likelihood analysis of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. Bayesian inference is performed on the baryon abundance and the effective number of neutrino species, Neff, using a CMB Boltzmann solver in combination with LINX, a new flexible and efficient BBN code. We marginalize over Planck nuisance parameters and nuclear rates to find Neff=3.08+0.13−0.13,2.94+0.16−0.16, or 2.98+0.14−0.13, for three separate reaction networks. This framework enables robust testing of the Lambda Cold Dark Matter paradigm and its variants with CMB and BBN data."
