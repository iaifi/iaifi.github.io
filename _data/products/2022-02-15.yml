title: "Identifying equivalent Calabi--Yau topologies: A discrete challenge from math and physics for machine learning"
authors: Vishnu Jejjala, Washington Taylor, Andrew Turner
abstract: "We review briefly the characteristic topological data of Calabiâ€“Yau threefolds and focus on the question of when two threefolds are equivalent through related topological data. This provides an interesting test case for machine learn- ing methodology in discrete mathematics problems motivated by physics."
