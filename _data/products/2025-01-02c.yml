abstract: "We present a detailed study of SN 2024ahr, a hydrogen-poor superluminous supernova (SLSN-I), for which we determine a redshift of z=0.0861. SN 2024ahr has a peak absolute magnitude of Mg≈Mr≈−21 mag, rest-frame rise and decline times (50% of peak) of about 40 and 80 days, respectively, and typical spectroscopic evolution in the optical band. Similarly, modeling of the UV/optical light curves with a magnetar spin-down engine leads to typical parameters: an initial spin period of ≈3.3 ms, a magnetic field strength of ≈6×1013 G, and an ejecta mass of ≈9.5 M⊙. Due to its relatively low redshift we obtained a high signal-to-noise ratio near-IR spectrum about 43 rest-frame days post-peak to search for the presence of helium. We do not detect any significant feature at the location of the He I λ2.058 μm feature, and place a conservative upper limit of ∼0.05 M⊙ on the mass of helium in the outer ejecta. We detect broad features of Mg I λ1.575 μm and a blend of Co II λ2.126 μm and Mg II, λ2.136 μm, which are typical of Type Ic SNe, but with higher velocities. Examining the sample of SLSNe-I with NIR spectroscopy, we find that, unlike SN 2024ahr, these events are generally peculiar. This highlights the need for a large sample of prototypical SLSNe-I with NIR spectroscopy to constrain the fraction of progenitors with helium (Ib-like) and without helium (Ic-like) at the time of the explosion, and hence the evolutionary path(s) leading to the rare outcome of SLSNe-I."
