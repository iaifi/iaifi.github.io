title: "Learning Silhouettes with Group Sparse Autoencoders"
authors: Emmanouil Theodosis and Demba Ba
abstract: "Sparse coding has been extensively used in neuroscience to model brain-like computation by drawing analogues between neuronsâ€™ firing activity and the nonzero elements of sparse vectors. Contemporary deep learning architectures have been used to model neural activity, inspired by signal processing algorithms; however sparse coding architectures are not able to explain the higher-order categorization that has been em- pirically observed at the neural level. In this work, we pro- pose a novel model-based architecture, termed group-sprase autoencoder, that produces sparse activity patterns in line with neural modeling, but showcases a higher-level order in its ac- tivation maps. We evaluate a dense model of our architecture on MNIST and CIFAR-10 and show that it learns dictionar- ies that resemble silhouettes of the given class, while its ac- tivations have a significantly higher level order compared to sparse architectures."
