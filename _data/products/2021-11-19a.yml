title: "New limits on light dark matter: proton cross section from the cosmic large-scale structure"

abstract: "We set the strongest limits to-date on the velocity-independent dark matter (DM) - proton cross section σ for DM masses m=10keV to 100GeV, using large-scale structure traced by the Lyman-alpha forest: e.g., a 95% lower limit σ<6×10−30cm2, for m=100keV. Our results complement direct detection, which has limited sensitivity to sub-GeV DM. We use an emulator of cosmological simulations, combined with data from the smallest cosmological scales used to-date, to model and search for the imprint of primordial DM-proton collisions. Cosmological bounds are improved by up to a factor of 25."
