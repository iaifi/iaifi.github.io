title: "TASI Lectures on Physics for Machine Learning"
authors: Jim Halverson
abstract: "These notes are based on lectures I gave at TASI 2024 on Physics for Machine Learning. The focus is on neural network theory, organized according to network expressivity, statistics, and dynamics. I present classic results such as the universal approximation theorem and neural network / Gaussian process correspondence, and also more recent results such as the neural tangent kernel, feature learning with the maximal update parameterization, and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks. The exposition on neural network theory emphasizes a field theoretic perspective familiar to theoretical physicists. I elaborate on connections between the two, including a neural network approach to field theory."
