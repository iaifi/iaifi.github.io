abstract: "We study the behavior of toric Landau-Ginzburg models under extremal contraction and minimal model program. We also establish a relation between the moduli space of toric Landau-Ginzburg models and the geography of central models. We conjecture that there is a correspondence between extremal contractions and minimal model program on Fano varieties, and degenerations of their associated toric Landau-Ginzburg models written explicitly. We prove the conjectures for smooth toric varieties, as well as general smooth Fano varieties in dimensions 2 and 3. As an application, we compute the elementary syzygies for smooth Fano threefolds."
