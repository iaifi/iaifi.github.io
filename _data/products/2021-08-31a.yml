title: "Machine-Learning media bias"
authors: Samantha D'Alonzo, Max Tegmark
abstract: We present an automated method for measuring media bias. Inferring which newspaper published a given article, based only on the frequencies with which it uses different phrases, leads to a conditional probability distribution whose analysis lets us automatically map newspapers and phrases into a bias space. By analyzing roughly a million articles from roughly a hundred newspapers for bias in dozens of news topics, our method maps newspapers into a two-dimensional bias landscape that agrees well with previous bias classifications based on human judgement. One dimension can be interpreted as traditional left-right bias, the other as establishment bias. This means that although news bias is inherently political, its measurement need not be.
