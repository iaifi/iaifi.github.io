interests: I investigate the applications of deep learning solutions in the DAQ system of the LHCb experiment at CERN as part of the MIT LHCb Group led by Prof. Mike Williams. My current interests comprise the deployment of robust monotonic neural networks in the LHCb beauty inclusive triggers and the development of graph neural networks for calorimetric cluster reconstruction.
