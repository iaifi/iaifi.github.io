  talk-title: "Towards a data-driven model of hadronization"
  talk-abstract: "We will discuss recent and ongoing developments at the intersection of machine learning and simulated hadronization. Specifically, we'll focus on some of the major challenges presented when attempting to build a data-driven model of hadronization that utilizes experimental data during training. Solutions to some of these challenges will be presented in the context of invertible neural networks or normalizing flows including the introduction of a new paradigm that allows for the training of microscopic hadronization dynamics from macroscopic event-level observables."

  talk-title: "Open-Source Simulation and Machine Learning for Neutrino Telescopes"
  talk-abstract: "In the last decade, the filed of neutrino astronomy has made major strides, culminating of the definitive detection of galactic and extragalactic components of the astrophysical neutrino flux. We can now  begin characterizing these astrophysical beams and pursuing new physics through them. Machine learning techniques have played an integral part in these recent advances, and while these current efforts have been impressive, it is clear that there is room to improve. This face, along with the growing, global network of neutrino telescopes, drives the need for open-source tools to use all person power and avoid reduplicating effort. In this talk I will present Prometheus, the first open-source, end-to-end simulation for neutrino telescopes. Furthermore, I will show a recent example of Prometheus to develop machine learning techniques capable of running at typical neutrino telescope trigger rates."

  talk-title: "Learning Group Representations in Neural Networks"
  talk-abstract: "Employing equivariance in neural networks leads to greater parameter efﬁciency via parameter sharing and improved generalization performance through the encoding of domain knowledge in the architecture; however, the majority of existing approaches require an a priori speciﬁcation of the data symmetries. We present a neural network architecture, Group Representation Networks (GRNs), that learns symmetries on the weight space of neural networks without any supervision or knowledge of the hidden symmetries in the data. Beyond their interpretability, GRNs’ learned representations distill symmetries of the data domain and the downstream task, which are incorporated when training networks on different datasets. The key idea behind GRNs relates weights in neural networks via a cyclic action whose group representation depends on the data domain, and is learned in an unsupervised manner. Our experiments underline the ability of GRNs to correctly recover symmetries in the data, show competitive performance when GRNs are used as a drop-in replacement for conventional layers, and highlight the ability to transfer learned representations across tasks and datasets."

  talk-title: "Two Watts is All You Need: Low-Power Machine Learning on TPU for Neutrino Telescopes"
  talk-abstract: "In neutrino experiments, we have seen machine learning software methods to boost our abilities of physics discovery given the hardware experimental setups. Currently, we face upgrades and new telescopes and experimental hardware expecting more statistics as well as more complicated data signals. This calls out for an upgrade on the software side as well for handling the more complex data in a more efficient way. Specifically, we need low power and fast software methods in order to achieve real time signal processing, where current machine learning base methods are too expensive to be deployed in the commonly power-restricted regions where these experiments are located. In this talk, I will present the first attempt at and a proof of concept for enabling machine learning methods to be deployed live in under water/ice neutrino telescopes via quantization and deployment on Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). We use an LSTM-based recursive neural network with residual convolution-based data encoding, combined with specifically tailored data pre-processing and quantization aware training methods for deployment on the Google Edge TPU. This algorithm can achieve state-of-the-art angular resolution in reconstruction with a real-time inference frequency of 100 Hz/Watts in a TPU accelerator at only 2 Watts of power consumption. This opens up a world of chances to integrate machine learning capacity into detectors and electronics deep into even the most power-restricted environments."

  talk-title: "GWAK: Gravitational Wave Anomalous Knowledge with Recurrent Autoencoders"
  talk-abstract: "Matched-filtering detection techniques for gravitational-wave (GW) signals in ground-based interferometers rely on having well-modeled templates of the GW emission. Such techniques have been traditionally used in searches for compact binary coalescences (CBCs), and have been employed in all known GW detections so far. However, interesting science cases aside from compact mergers do not yet have accurate enough modeling to make matched filtering possible, including core-collapse supernovae and sources where stochasticity may be involved. Therefore the development of techniques to identify sources of these types is of significant interest. In this paper, we present a method of anomaly detection based on deep recurrent autoencoders to enhance the search region to unmodeled transients. We use a semi-supervised strategy that we name Gravitational Wave Anomalous Knowledge (GWAK). While the semi-supervised nature of the problem comes with a cost in terms of accuracy as compared to supervised techniques, there is a qualitative advantage in generalizing experimental sensitivity beyond pre-computed signal templates. We construct a low-dimensional embedded space using the GWAK method, capturing the physical signatures of distinct signals on each axis of the space. By introducing signal priors that capture some of the salient features of GW signals, we allow for the recovery of sensitivity even when an unmodeled anomaly is encountered. We show that regions of the GWAK space can identify CBCs, detector glitches and also a variety of unmodeled astrophysical sources."

  talk-title: "Conditional normalizing flows for IceCube event reconstruction"
  talk-abstract: "In this seminar, I will talk about normalizing flows (NFs), in particular about the types that are useful for high-energy neutrino event reconstruction in IceCube. First, I will give an introduction that focuses on essentially two different classes of flows which have quite a citation disparity in the literature: 1)  normalizing flows in high dimensions (D>~100), which typically have high citation counts, and 2) normalizing flows in low dimensions (D = 1 - 100),  which are typically cited less frequently. I discuss the reasons why I think this latter class, which is often less known, is in particular useful for high-energy physicists, and then briefly review two examples of that class: specific Gaussianization flows (2003.01941) , and exponential-map flows (0906.0874/2002.02428). Finally, I discuss a recent application of these particular flows as  conditional NFs for neutrino event econstruction in the IceCube detector (2309.16380)."
