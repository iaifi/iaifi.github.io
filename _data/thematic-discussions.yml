  talk-title: "Interpretable AI"
  talk-abstract: "As AI systems become increasingly central to scientific discovery, interpretability is emerging as a critical concernâ€”both in the natural sciences (e.g., physics) and within machine learning itself (e.g., natural language processing). But what exactly do we mean by interpretable machines? In this session, we will begin with an introduction by Ziming Liu (MIT), followed by two lightning talks:<br>1. Matthew Schwartz (Harvard): Transformers for Symbolic Formulas (interpretable outputs for physics)<br>2. Naomi Saphra (Harvard): Mechanistic Interpretability (interpretable internals for NLP)<br> A guided discussion will follow, centered on key questions:<br>1. What are your (least) favourite tools or examples of interpretability in action?<br>2. Is interpretability positively or negatively correlated with performance?<br>3. What will doing science be like in 5 years? And in 50 years?"

  talk-abstract: "Many of the recent successes in AI rely on the manifold hypothesis: that most high-dimensional data lie on a lower-dimensional manifold. From transfer to contrastive learning to foundation modeling, significant effort has been devoted to methods to efficiently find and map input data to this latent space. In this Thematic Discussion Session, we'll hear from three distinguished speakers on extracting meaningful latent representations from data from the physical sciences: Aizhan Akhmetzhanova (Self-Supervised Learning for Data Compression and Inference in Cosmology), Nate Woodward, (Product Manifold Machine Learning for Physics) and David Baek, (GenEFT: Physics-Inspired Theory of Representation Learning). After three 10-minute lightning talks, we'll have a 30 minute open discussion/Q&A session to explore the major challenges and opportunities in this field. We encourage attendees to come with questions and insights from their own work!"

  talk-abstract: "In 2024, IAIFI launched a research partnership with UMass Boston. The partnership is focused on developing physics-informed reinforcement learning approaches to solve problems in quantum science and technology; in particular, developing novel approaches for entropy-regularized RL to advance current research in quantum systems and applying entropy-regularized RL tools to solve optimization problems in quantum science and technology. The event will kick off with presentations from UMass Boston researchers on this topic. We invite IAIFI researchers with research relevant to this project to sign up to give lightning talks as well (~10 minutes each). [Sign up to give a lightning talk](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/21c4df3869f04eb6877d97ff113121a9)."
