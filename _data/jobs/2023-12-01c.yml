details: 'The Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI) group is a quickly growing group embedded in the Data and AI cluster at the Eindhoven University of Technology. In the cluster, we aim at developing foundations of AI for the present and the future. This includes the design of new AI methods, development of AI algorithms and tools with a view at expanding the reach of AI and its generalization abilities. In particular, we study foundational issues of robustness, safety, trust, reliability, tractability, scalability, interpretability and explainability of AI. We seek a postdoctoral researcher to enhance our strengths in research and education. The successful candidate will work with topics related to theoretical AI and machine learning, and will play a significant role in the NWO Perspectief Project Personalized Oncology.'
