details: "​We are seeking an internationally recognized researcher in the field of language technology with extensive expertise in natural language processing and machine learning methodologies. Particular interest will be given to candidates with experience in training, analysing, developing and improving large-scale neural architectures. In addition to holding a professorship at the university, the successful candidate will also be appointed as a scientific director at the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI), where they will head a research department with access to an extensive global network of industry and other partners. This dual role offers a unique platform for high-impact research and meaningful societal engagement at a scale rarely achievable elsewhere. DFKI is an application-driven research organization that is largely financed through external project funding. Experience in collaborating with non-academic partners and in attracting national and international research funding is therefore desirable."
