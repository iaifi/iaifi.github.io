details: ' The School of Physics at the Georgia Institute of Technology invites applications for two open-rank tenure-track faculty positions at the interface between machine learning and physics. We anticipate hiring faculty working on advancing machine learning methodology as applied to quantum science, astrophysics, physics of living systems, nonlinear science, soft matter physics or other related areas. The faculty will be part of a new initiative to catalyze machine-learning-driven research in the School of Physics and will benefit from substantial expertise and resources in artificial intelligence and machine learning that already exist in the Colleges of Sciences, Engineering, and Computing. Appointments at senior ranks will be considered for candidates with established and internationally recognized research programs. Candidates are expected to have received a doctorate in Physics or a related discipline and demonstrate a record of advancing the methodology and applications of machine learning in Physics. Successful candidates will have expertise in teaching, scholarship, and/or service.'
