details: "The department of Physics and Astronomy at Johns Hopkins University invites applications for (i) multiple independent postdoctoral fellowships and (ii) PhD students to work on the theoretical foundations of (Machine) Learning. Outstanding candidates will be selected to join the Physics of Learning research group led by profs Brice Ménard and Matthieu Wyart. This group will significantly expand in the next couple of years, with the addition of several new faculty members and their respective associates.<br><br>Research on the theoretical foundations of Learning is highly synergistic. Our members interact with colleagues in the departments of cognitive & neuroscience, computer science and applied mathematics and statistics. This research program also benefits from Johns Hopkins’ major AI initiative, with the addition of new AI faculty across multiple departments and the creation of a new Data Science and AI Institute."
