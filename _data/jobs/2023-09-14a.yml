details: 'Nominations required. Nominations must be submitted via the Simons Award Manager (SAM) under the nominatorâ€™s SAM account. Only one nomination per individual is permitted. 
Applications for a Junior Fellowship are by nomination only. The request for nominations is sent to a targeted list of scientists and is also open to faculty from Ph.D.-granting institutions in New York City (i.e., in Brooklyn, Manhattan, Staten Island, Queens or the Bronx), including medical institutions that are affiliated with such an institution. The foundation strongly encourages the nomination of candidates from underrepresented backgrounds.'
