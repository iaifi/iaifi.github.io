details: "​The NGT Real-time Reconstruction Revolution will transform the CMS High-Level Trigger into an offline-quality reconstruction facility processing up to 750 kHz of events. To make this sustainable, you will lead the design of two complementary data tiers: a low-level reconstructed format that enables trigger rates several times higher than conventional raw-data output while preserving the the option for future reprocessing, and a compact analysis format to save the full 750 kHz stream of online reconstructed events."
