details: "â€‹Human Computer Interaction (HCI) explores the design, evaluation, and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use, as well as the broader social and ethical implications of computer systems. Candidates should have a strong background in computer science or a related discipline and an excellent research record in HCI, as documented by publications in relevant top venues (such as ACM CHI, ACM UIST, CSCW, TOCHI, IEEE VIS, or IEEE TSMC) and by successful acquisition of research grants. We are also welcoming candidates with demonstrated interest and experience in inter- and transdisciplinary research in HCI. Relevant research focus areas include, but are not limited to: Human-centered design and user experience, interactive and intelligent systems, critical computing, sustainability and social justice, collaborative and social computing, mixed, augmented, and virtual reality, affective computing and human-AI interaction, and ethical, societal, artistic and environmental aspects of digital technologies. Candidates should be committed to high-quality teaching in HCI and other general areas in computer science."
