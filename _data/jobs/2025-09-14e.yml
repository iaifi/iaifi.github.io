details: "​Deep learning models, and in particular large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but remain limited by their heavy computational requirements, lack of interpretability, and tendency to produce unreliable outputs (“hallucinations”). This project investigates whether quantum computing can enable a new generation of generative AI models that are more efficient, theoretically grounded, and explainable. The research sits at the crossroads of quantum information science, tensor network theory, and generative modeling (transformers, diffusion models, etc.)."
