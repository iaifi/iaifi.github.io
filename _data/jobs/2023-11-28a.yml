details: 'The Center for Data Science (CDS) at New York University (NYU) invites applications for its highly prestigious CDS Faculty Fellow positions. Building on the success of the Moore-Sloan Fellows program, CDS has created a Faculty Fellow program to continue to develop outstanding researchers in Data Science. The CDS Faculty Fellow will be expected to work at the boundaries between the data-science methods and domain sciences. They are also encouraged to develop collaborations with faculty at CDS and NYU. They will lead original research projects of their choosing with impact in one or more scientific domains and in one or more methodological domains (computer science, statistics, and applied mathematics).'
