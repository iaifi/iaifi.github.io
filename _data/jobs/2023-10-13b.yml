details: 'The Department of Physics at the University of California, Berkeley, has an opening for a Postdoctoral Scholar to develop novel approaches to the unbinned analysis of collider data using Machine Learning. These developments will be used to explore Quantum Chromodynamics in new ways, using archived Deep Inelastic Scattering data from the H1 experiment at HERA and simulations for the future Electron Ion Collider. The research will be carried out within the group of Ben Nachman at UC Berkeley and LBNL, in collaboration with the groups of Miguel Arratia (UC Riverside) and Peter Jacobs (UC Berkeley/LBNL).'
