details: NLP is becoming an increasingly powerful tool for social scientists. Yet, the intersection between the two disciplines is still poorly explored, with research in the two disciplines often being conducted as separate streams. The goal of this project is to research methods which can more directly be useful for downstream social science applications. One such application is to analyse common narratives in news, which requires methods including (interpretable) topic modelling, framing detection, social media analysis, etc.
