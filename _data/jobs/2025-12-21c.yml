details: "​The professorship is embedded within the Excellence Cluster 'Machine Learning: New Perspectives for Science', which is now entering its second funding phase. The successful candidate is expected to have an established research profile in a core area of physics, as well as a strong track record in research questions related to machine learning and/or artificial intelligence. Core areas of physics include the structure of condensed matter (description of many-body systems), quantum physics (characterization of quantum states in many-body systems), and theoretical particle physics. In all of these areas, methodological development through machine learning is taking place — for example, in predicting the evolution of complex molecular systems over long timescales, investigating quantum mechanical effects in information processing within (quantum) neural networks, or in elementary particle physics at high-energy accelerators.
