details: This position will contribute to the research programme of the recently founded "AI Hub in Generative Models", a research consortium funded by EPSRC. The goal of the programme is to do research in the area of deep generative models, e.g., diffusion, energy based, normalizing flow or transformer-based models. With a focus on the particular domain of molecules. The project will contribute to accelerate the drug discovery process, leading to more economic and effective drugs that can significantly improve the health and lifestyle of millions. The resulting methods are also expected to have an impact in materials science, e.g, by leading to more effective batteries.
