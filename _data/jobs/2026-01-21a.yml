details: "​Perimeter Institute invites applications for a tenure-track faculty position at the intersection of Theoretical Physics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) (a rank equivalent to the level of assistant professor). Exceptional candidates may be considered for a tenured senior faculty appointment. We welcome applicants whose research explores any aspect of the physics of AI or the application of AI to physics, broadly defined. The rapidly evolving interface between physics and AI represents an exciting frontier in modern quantitative science. The physics of AI investigates the theoretical foundations of learning systems to explain why AI models work. Conversely, AI for physics leverages probabilistic modeling and machine learning to accelerate physical discovery."
