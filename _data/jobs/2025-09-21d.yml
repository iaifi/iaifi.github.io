details: "â€‹CHAI Research Fellows will work with CHAI faculty members Stuart Russell, Pieter Abbeel, and Anca Dragan and will also have the opportunity to collaborate with CHAI affiliate faculty at Berkeley, other faculty members in Berkeley AI Research (where CHAI is located), and many other institutions. The Fellowship is aimed at training highly qualified postdoctoral researchers to carry out research to advance beneficial AI. Given the broad and open-ended mandate of the Center to develop provably beneficial AI systems, the post holder will have considerable freedom to pursue novel research projects in areas such as reasoning, decision making, learning, multi-agent systems, and philosophical foundations using the tools of probability theory, game theory, control theory, etc."
