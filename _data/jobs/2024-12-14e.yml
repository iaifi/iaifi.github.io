details: "Applications are invited for multiple positions at both Research Associate and Senior Research Associate level as Mathematical-AI-Researchers (postdoctoral positions) in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics as part of the new Infosys-Cambridge AI Lab to work at the interface of science and machine learning. The AI Lab has been created to facilitate reserch in the following themes: agentic AI (multi-agent systems, RL), theoretical machine learning, symbolic AI, and simulation-based approaches. The goal of the AI Lab is to drive scientific discoveries through automation, and to build a mathematical understanding of machine learning using methods from theoretical physics that have wide application beyond science. To facilitate these advances, we seek a talented, promising, and diverse group of researchers with a completed (or near completed) PhD in physics, machine learning or applied mathematics or related fields. Your role as Mathematical-AI-Researcher is to develop and conduct individual and collaborative research within one or more of the themes listed above and to identify and pursue synergies in an interdisciplinary context. You must be able to communicate material of a technical nature beyond your immediate scientific field (e.g. to policymakers or industry leaders) and to enable discussion of real-world applications."
