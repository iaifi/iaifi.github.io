details: 'The Harvard Data Science Initiative (HDSI) is seeking applications for its flagship Harvard Data Science Postdoctoral Fellows Program for the 2023-2024 academic year. The normal duration of the Fellowship is two years. Fellows will receive a generous salary as well as an annual allocation for research and travel expenses. We are looking for researchers whose interests are in data science, broadly construed, and including researchers with a primarily methodological focus as well as researchers who advance both methodology and application. Fellows will be provided with the opportunity to pursue their research agenda in an intellectually vibrant environment with ample mentorship. We are looking for independent researchers who will seek out collaborations with other fellows and with faculty across all schools of Harvard University. We recognize that strength comes through diversity and actively seek and welcome people with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and identities.'
