details: 'As a Senior Data Scientist at the Swiss Data Science Center, you will use your expertise in machine learning, statistics, computer vision, natural language processing, or related fields to help domain experts working in earth and environmental science, physical and engineering sciences, biology, biotechnologies, personalized medicine and health, computational social science, economics, and more, to identify how to analyze or model their data, and to answer precise scientific questions or develop algorithms that perform automatically some challenging tasks.

This involves exchanging actively and regularly with the domain experts to understand the precise desiderata of the project in domain science terms, translating it in data science terms, determining which approaches and formulations are most effective to achieve the desired goals, implement the corresponding algorithms, perform the evaluations hand-in-hand with the domain experts, and eventually release opensource code and write research papers in the domain science with the domains expertise, and contribute to the communication of the results.'
