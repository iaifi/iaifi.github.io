details: "​The theoretical high energy physics group at the University of Toronto aims to fill two postdoctoral research positions starting in the Fall of 2026. The postdocs will primarily work with Yonatan Kahn at University of Toronto, in collaboration with Noam Levi at EPFL and Andrew Larkoski at APS, on a suite of projects focused on using simulated jet data as a model of complex real-world data in order to make progress on AI interpretability and alignment. These positions are for 2 years, but may be renewable for a 3rd year subject to funds and performance."
