details: "The University of Liverpool is seeking to appoint two highly motivated post-doctoral researchers to work with the recently awarded Future Leaders Fellow, Dr Juri Smirnov, on new searches for dark matter. These positions are part of the Theoretical Physics Division in the Department of Mathematical Sciences, within the School of Physical Sciences.<br><br>Dr. Smirnov's group focuses on sub-GeV dark matter detection and collaborates closely with the QUEST DMC experiment. One of the core goals is the development of new search strategies with superfluids and the investigation on sub-threshold effects on quantum systems. The group also leverages generative AI to search for new light dark matter targets and explores additional research areas such as the capture of dark matter in celestial bodies and its effect on their evolution. This research involves collaboration with the Chemistry Department at MIT and the Theoretical Physics Division at Princeton University."
