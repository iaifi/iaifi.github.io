details: "​We are looking for an exceptional researcher who will play a major role in new initiatives in the lab to develop novel artificial intelligence (AI)/deep learning (DL) approaches to further understanding of the microbiome–the trillions of microbes living on and within us—and its interactions with mammalian cells. Areas of interest include developing new probabilistic AI/DL approaches to analyze longitudinal multi-modal (e.g., sequencing, metabolomics, spatial-omics) microbiome data while incorporating prior biological knowledge and leveraging AI/DL techniques such as LLMs to facilitate interpretation and application of results."
