details: 'The Department of Computing Science at the University of Alberta invites applications for two tenure-track positions (Assistant or, in exceptional cases, Associate Professor level), starting as early as July 1st, 2024, in the areas of Machine Learning (ML)/deep learning theory and Natural Language Processing with a focus on ML/deep learning. Other areas of expertise in Artifical Intelligence and Machine Learning may be considered. The successful candidates must hold a Ph.D. (or equivalent) degree, whose primary focus is in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, or Natural Language Processing, by the appointment date. They are expected to have demonstrated research potential strong enough for a promising nomination as Canada CIFAR AI Chair, evidenced by publications in top venues (conferences or journals) within their area of AI. They should also have strong communication skills and demonstrated commitment to highly effective graduate and undergraduate teaching. They will be expected to establish their own funded research programs, supervise graduate students, and teach graduate and undergraduate courses. Strong potential for productive interactions with other researchers in the Department and in other disciplines at the University of Alberta will be considered an asset.'
