details: 'The School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh invites applications for Research Associate / Postdoctoral position in machine learning and large language models. Large language models are playing a crucial role in the new generation of generative AI technologies, which have brought about significant changes and breakthroughs from a technological perspective. However, many of these models are complex and incredibly extensive, comprising millions of parameters that are difficult to comprehend. Early evaluations suggest that these models often provide inconsistent answers. They do not conform to mathematical or logical principles, although they do exhibit some level of logical reasoning.'
