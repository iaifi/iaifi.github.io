details: "​Physicists come in many forms. Some love tinkering and may be natural experimentalists, some are drawn to elegant theories, some delight in writing computer codes, some have a special talent for communicating science to others, etc. And physicists do many different things in their lives, from public education, to academic research, to industry and tech, to public service and beyond. The goal of the NYU Graduate Program in Physics is to provide outstanding training to a student body which reflects the diversity of backgrounds, talents and skills of the next generation of aspiring physicists, astrophysicists and biophysicists. We want every member of the Department to flourish and find their own path. Our graduate admissions process aims to bring in a capable and committed group of students who are well-positioned to benefit from the training we can provide. No single metric gives a valid and accurate gauge for every person. To that end, admissions decisions are based on the full scope of information in the application dockets, and any individual component is considered in relation to its relevance for the student’s aims."
