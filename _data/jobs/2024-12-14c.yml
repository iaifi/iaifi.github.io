details: "A postdoctoral position is available in the Geometric Machine Learning Group at Harvard University, led by Prof. Melanie Weber. This role offers an opportunity to perform research at the intersection of Geometry and Machine Learning, with a focus on studying geometric structures in data and models and how to leverage such structure for the design of efficient machine learning algorithms with provable guarantees. Research areas include Representation Learning, Machine learning and Optimization on graphs and manifolds, as well as applications of geometric methods in the Sciences."
