details: 'We are looking for a post-doctoral research fellow with a strong machine learning background to work with Profs Luc Berthouze and George Parisis on one of 77 adventurous new projects recently funded by the EPSRC under the New Horizons initiative to explore high-risk speculative research ideas across Engineering and ICT.
Our project aims to transform the way ICT networks are being conceptualised for management, by developing a data-driven (e.g., temporal network based) characterisation of emerging dependencies between ICT components and allowing to characterise and act upon the functional impact of complex and changing interactions across layers and processes.'
