details: "​The Department of Informatics at King’s College London is looking to appoint a Postdoctoral Research Associate or Fellow to work in the area of technical AI safety. The position is funded by the Open Philanthropy grant “Verifiably Robust Conformal Probes”. The project’s goal is to develop methods for latent probing (aka activation monitoring) of large language models (LLMs) that leverage certification and conformal prediction techniques to offer probabilistic and adversarial robustness guarantees. Applications include detection of misaligned LLM intentions such as deception, harmfulness, jailbreaking, and power-seeking behaviours."
