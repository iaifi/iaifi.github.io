details: "The Collaborative Artificial Intelligence (CAI) group at the University of Stuttgart in Germany, headed by Prof. Andreas Bulling, is inviting applications for several prestigious Humboldt Postdoctoral Fellowships.<br><br>The CAI group (https://collaborative-ai.org/) conducts fundamental research towards collaborative artificial intelligence at the intersection of multimodal machine learning, multi-agent reinforcement learning, computational cognitive modelling, computer vision, and human-AI interaction. We have a strong presence at the top conferences in these research fields and, as such, are among the few truly interdisciplinary groups in Germany and Europe. We are highly visible internationally, and publications from the group are frequently distinguished with best paper awards. So far, out of 14 PhD and PostDoc alumni, seven have assumed faculty positions at leading institutions worldwide, several others have jointed industrial research labs. Close links exist to the International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems (IMPRS-IS) and the local Max Planck Institute, the ELLIS Unit Stuttgart, the Centre for Bionic Intelligence Tübingen Stuttgart (BITS), as well as several large-scale research projects within the University of Stuttgart.<br><br>We are seeking outstanding candidates with an exceptional research track record and strong publications at the top venues in the above fields. Successful candidates will be able to pursue their own research program, will contribute to the preparation and leadership of research projects, will have the opportunity to advise undergraduate and graduate students, and contribute to the teaching activities of the group. They will have access to excellent research infrastructure, including distinguished lectures, research seminars, and invited talks by international guests, extensive technical equipment (e.g. eye and fully body motion trackers, various wearable physiological sensors, VR/AR headsets), as well as our own high-performance GPU cluster.<br><br>ABOUT THE HUMBOLDT FELLOWSHIPS<br><br>The Postdoctoral Fellowships are competitive, fully funded for two years and, upon successful nomination, granted directly by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation after only a formal check. This light-weight process provides a unique, fast-track option for obtaining a postdoctoral research position as it allows successful candidates to start working in our group within only a few weeks (not including any visa application process, if required). In addition to the fellowship amount itself, a mobility allowance, a subsidy towards the cost of medical and liability insurance, and a lump sum for travel expenses and an initial lump sum are paid. A family allowance for accompanying partners and/or children under 18 will be granted if they are staying in Germany for at least three months. Intensive German language courses are available. Fellows will become part of the world-wide Humboldt Research Network, making them eligible for various forms of alumni sponsorship upon successful completion of the research stay.<br><br>The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation wants to promote diversity and, thus, candidates from under-represented groups and female junior researchers from abroad are particularly encouraged to apply.<br><br>Important formal criteria include:<br>- Doctorate completed within the last 4 years<br>- Above-average publication record, commensurate with career level<br>- No previous post-doctoral research stay nor completed degrees/doctorates in Germany<br>- No German nationality<br>- Very good knowledge of English<br>- No previous application to the Humboldt Foundation; no previous sponsorship in any of the Foundation’s fellowship programmes.<br><br>ABOUT THE UNIVERSITY OF STUTTGART<br><br>The University of Stuttgart is cradled in what is simultaneously one of Germany's most beautiful landscapes and one of Europe's most economically successful areas. The region is known for a high standard of living, beautiful surroundings, and easy access to other major metropolitan areas. The university is one of the top nine leading and oldest technical universities (TU9) in Germany and consistently ranked among the world's best universities in international rankings. The University of Stuttgart is part of the Cyber Valley initiative (https://cyber-valley.de/en), a new center for artificial intelligence research that brings together partners from science and industry to boost intelligent systems research and development in the Stuttgart-Tübingen region, specifically in the areas of machine learning, robotics, and computer vision.<br><br>The Department of Computer Science is located on the university campus in Stuttgart Vaihingen. It is devoted to cutting-edge research in computer science ranging from foundations (algorithms, programming logics, computer architecture) to a variety of application domains (computer vision and graphics, machine learning and robotics, intelligent systems). With its vibrant research environment and its attractive Bachelor and Master programs, the Department attracts top students from all over the world. The department offers a stimulating, competitive, and collaborative work environment. It is equipped with high-class research facilities and has links to leading international companies in and around Stuttgart (e.g. Bosch AI, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche).<br><br>APPLICATIONS<br><br>Applications and inquiries should be sent to Prof. Dr. Andreas Bulling (see contact details below). Applications must be submitted by email as a single pdf (max. 10 MB) and include a CV, motivation letter with research statement, publication list, transcripts of BSc and MSc degrees, and contact details of 2-3 references. Optionally, up to five selected own publications or theses can be included in a second pdf (max. 5 MB). Applications should also indicate earliest date of availability. There is no fixed application deadline; applications are continuously considered as positions become available, staggered over a three-year timeframe from 2025-2027.<br><br>--<br>Prof. Dr. Andreas Bulling<br>Full Professor<br>Collaborative Artificial Intelligence<br><br>Executive Board, International Max-Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems (IMPRS-IS) <br><br>Founding Director, Stuttgart ELLIS Unit<br><br>ELLIS Fellow<br><br>Institute for Visualisation and Interactive Systems (VIS)<br>University of Stuttgart<br>Pfaffenwaldring 5a, 70569 Stuttgart, Germany<br><br>Email: andreas.bulling@vis.uni-stuttgart.de<br><br>URL: https://collaborative-ai.org/people/bulling/"
