details: "​ARIAC is a large project funded by the Walloon Region with about 50 researchers in AI in all five French-speaking universities of Belgium. Prof. Benoît Frénay is recruiting a postdoc for up to 2 years inside the human-centered machine learning (HuMaLearn) team. The research topics will be discussed with the candidate and should be aligned with the research interests of HuMaLearn in sustainable and trustworthy AI. Examples of topics in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) that are relevant include energy-efficient DL models (at learning or inference), trustworthiness of sequential DL models (e.g., interpretability, constraint satisfaction, visualisation of inner working, data augmentation for robustness), dimensionality reduction, interaction mechanisms for ML or DL and the Rashomon effect in ML or DL.<br><br>The goal of this postdoctoral research is to (i) do research in topics that will be defined with Benoît Frénay and (ii) help Benoît Frénay to coordinate the ARIAC project at the UNamur level. The candidate will also need to spend 15% of her/his time on applied research challenges proposed by the applied research centers that are partners in ARIAC. This will be an opportunity to extend her/his network and to work on exciting questions with real data."
