details: "The UCD School of Computer Science is seeking to recruit an assistant professor in the area of Human AI Collaboration. With the advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and, especially, Large Language Models (LLMs) there is a great debate in academia, industry and society about the extent to which Artificial Intelligence (AI) may equal or surpass Human Intelligence. This debate informs our understanding of the differences between Human Intelligence and AI and also informs research on Human AI Collaboration. As AI increasingly supports humans in performing different tasks, from improving medical diagnostics to vehicle navigation, harnessing the strategic partnership between human intelligence and AI technology is crucial."
