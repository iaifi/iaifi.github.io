details: Online content can include multiple different modalities, ranging from text to images or tables. Increasingly, detecting false information requires the understanding of a combination of these modalities and the relationship between them. This project will focus on developing general-purpose multi-modal methods for automatic fact checking in various domains, such as scientific publications, news or social media.
