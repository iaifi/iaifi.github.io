details: This project aims to harness the power of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to solve online stochastic optimization problems (OSOPs). The main objective of this project is to show that gamification presents an opportunity to extend the achievements of the DRL community to solve hard OSOPs by using new problem formulations that apply a visual representation to classical problem models.
