details: 'The Laboratory for Nuclear Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has an opening for a Postdoctoral Research Associate to work on the LHCb experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The position is available from the 1st Feb 2023 onwards. The MIT LHCb group consists of two faculty, Mike Williams and Eluned Smith, one research scientist, three post-docs, along with graduate and undergraduate students. The group focuses on rare penguin decays, dark sectors, and proton structure, and works on many aspects of the real-time analysis (trigger) system. The candidate will focus primarily on rare penguin decays and commissioning of electron modes with early Run 3 data, working under the supervision of Prof. Smith. Depending on candidate preference, development of software and algorithms for both current and future trigger systems is possible, as well as work on projects within the Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions (IAIFI) (https://iaifi.org). The appointment will initially be for two years, and may be renewed for additional one-year increments contingent upon satisfactory performance and available funding. Although this call is for a single position, multiple hires may be considered, depending on the candidate pool.'
