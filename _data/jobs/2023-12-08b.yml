details: 'Microsoft Research New York City is seeking applicants for multiple postdoctoral researcher positions with theoretical focus in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), both broadly in theoretical ML, and specifically in the areas of modular transfer learning, representation learning for reinforcement learning (RL), exploration in RL (including bandits), and in areas that bridge theoretical ML/RL interests with other research areas in the lab. We encourage applicants with mixed theory + empirical focus to apply to this posting as well as our parallel posting with empirical focus.'
