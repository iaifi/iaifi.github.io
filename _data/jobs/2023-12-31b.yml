details: 'The Center for Computational Neuroscience (CCN) invites applications for Flatiron Research Fellowships (FRFs - our designation for Postdoctoral Fellows) in the Connectomics project of CCN’s neural circuits and algorithms (NCA) group.  The goal of the CCN NCA group is to understand how the brain analyzes large and complex datasets streamed by sensory organs in order to aid efforts at building artificial neural systems and treating mental illness.  The Connectomics project of the NCA group, specifically, is focused on reconstruction the brain wiring diagram of the microscopic wasp utilizing automated high-throughput reconstruction software, results that are then verified by a team of research analysts who proofread and annotate the software’s work; using this method, the Connectomics project has assembled the largest connectome to date based on synapse count.  While the current open position is in the neural circuits and algorithms group only, CCN scientists are encouraged to collaborate across research groups and the wider Flatiron Institute.'
