details: "​EECS is seeking applicants from all research areas with priority given to overall originality and promise versus sub-area of specialization. In addition to these broad area searches, EECS has a focused search in quantum computing theory and systems as well as a focused search in “AI, Inequality, and Society” that is part of a cluster research initiative across multiple units to address questions related to the myriad ways in which AI may reshape individual lives, possibly exacerbating existing inequalities and creating new ones. This can include research in algorithmic fairness, AI and the economy, functioning of AI software within larger sociotechnical systems, social and behavioral impacts of AI, AI and education, generative AI and large language models."
