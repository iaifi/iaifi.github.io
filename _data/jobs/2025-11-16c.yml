details: "​The project will develop privacy-aware machine learning (ML) models. We focus on data-driven models for complex and temporal data, including those built from synthetic sources. Within privacy, we are interested in different types of privacy measures and models (differential and integral privacy, k-anonymity), different scenarios (centralized and decentralized data; local and global privacy). For decentralized data, we consider federated learning. We are interested in privacy-preserving machine learning at a scale."
