details: "The Cardiff University Gravity Exploration Institute and the Institute for Cosmic Ray Research at the University of Tokyo are seeking applications to fill the position of Postdoctoral Research Associate. The area of focus will be Simulation-Based Inference for Gravitational-wave analysis of black holes and neutron stars. Expertise in CNN, Normalising Flows, and Bayesian Neural Networks is particularly relevant, as well as willingness to learn about Gravitational Waves required (but not pre-existing knowledge necessary). The successful applicant will be developing rapid and accurate characterization of gravitational-wave signals from black holes and neutron stars using deep learning, and analysing data from the LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA observatories. The appointment will be based at the Gravity Exploration Institute of Cardiff University, with significant periods of time at the Institute for Cosmic Ray Research of the University of Tokyo. The precise timing is flexible and will be discussed with the applicant. This post is funded by The Royal Society."
