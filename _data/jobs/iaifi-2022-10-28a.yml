details: The CfA Postdoctoral Fellowship is intended for recent Ph.D. recipients who do not already have extensive postdoctoral experience. The Fellowship supports innovative astrophysics research by offering to the next generation of researchers full access to the unique facilities, research staff and resources of the Harvard and Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA). Past CfA Postdoctoral Fellows have gone on to faculty and research positions at major universities and research centers, and have received some of astrophysics' most important awards. Two former CfA Fellows are Nobel laureates. Successful candidates will be outstanding researchers with demonstrated promise in theory, observation, instrumentation and/or laboratory or experimental astrophysics. The CfA will award at least one CfA Fellowship and may award additional Fellowships depending on the strengths of the applicant pool. Only applicants who receive their degrees between January 1, 2023 and September 1, 2024 will be considered.
