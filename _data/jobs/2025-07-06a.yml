details: "â€‹As part of the ERC Advanced grant BALM, Idiap Research Institute seeks qualified candidates for a postdoctoral researcher position at the intersection of machine learning and natural language processing. This researcher wil investigate memory-augmented large language models (LLMs, RAG) using our recent results in representation learning and knowledge-graph embedding. Together we will leverage and extend our variational-Bayesian theory of how transformers represent information to develop new LLM architectures with improved controllability and interpretability, leading to novel applications and their evaluation."
