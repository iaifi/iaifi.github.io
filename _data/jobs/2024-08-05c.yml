details: Postdoctoral Fellows will be expected to propose work on research topics of their interest related to machine learning and deep learning and carry out that research with a great deal of independence. Should they be so inclined, Postdoctoral Fellows may teach and mentor at the Institute; engage in entrepreneurial activities; and/or work with existing companies to enhance their research. They have the ability to collaborate with the graduate students of the machine learning group at the University of Toronto, as well as the graduate students of other affiliated faculty, who spend the bulk of their time at the Institute. The standard term for a Postdoctoral Fellow position is 1–2 years, with a possible extension to 3 years. Also available is the opportunity for eligible individuals to complete a placement at Vector before going on to take a faculty role elsewhere.
