details: "â€‹The High Energy Theory Group (HET) has active programs in many areas of theoretical particle physics.  There are strong efforts in neutrino physics, Beyond the Standard Model phenomenology, precision calculations for the LHC and intensity frontier, overlaps of particle physics and cosmology, and lattice gauge theory. The lattice efforts span weak interaction physics, precision calculations of (g-2) and PDF determinations, and the development of new algorithms, among others.<br><br>The successful candidate will be expected to conduct research focused on precision tests of the Standard Model and/or beyond the Standard Model physics at the proposed Electron-Ion collider.  Priority will be given to those whose research proposal demonstrates high intellectual merit and the willingness to use machine learning and/or AI techniques."
