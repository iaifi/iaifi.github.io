details: 'The mission of the MIT Pappalardo Fellowships in Physics is to sustain a distinguished postdoctoral program that identifies, recruits and supports the most talented and promising young physicists at an early stage in their careers. This initiative is made possible by the support of Mr. A. Neil Pappalardo (EE â€™64), an MIT alumnus with a long history of generosity to both the Institute and the Department of Physics. Each year, the program appoints three new Fellows for a three-year term each, via its annual competition.'
