details: "â€‹At Chandar Lab and Mila, the Quebec AI Institute, we have four open postdoctoral positions on the following topics:<br><br>(1) Postdoc position on large language models (LLMs)<br>Topics of interest include but not limited to better pre-training methods, better fine-tuning methods, bias and fairness, interpretability, safety and alignment, continual pre-training.<br><br>(2) Postdoc position on foundation models for biological data<br>Topics of interest include but not limited to foundation models (both encoder and decoder models) for proteins, small molecules, and genomics data, multi-modal foundation models for biological data, 3d generative modelling, drug discovery.<br>For this position, we are looking for a candidate with strong ML/LLM/Transformers/Foundation Models background. If you do not have the biological domain background, but are interested in exploring AI for science, this is a perfect position for you. In this position, you will be working closely with our pharmaceutical partners who are experts in biology.<br><br>(3) Postdoc position on foundation models for time series data<br>Topics of interest includes but not limited to better sequential architectures, state space models, recurrent neural networks, attention-free architectures, etc.<br><br>(4) Postdoc position on foundation models for Astrophysics<br>The topics of interest includes but not limited to recurrent inference machines, Transformers, diffusion models for radio images in Astrophysics."
