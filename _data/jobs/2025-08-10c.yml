details: "â€‹This PDF position is focused on ML in realistic settings referring to statistical and system characteristics in the real world contrary to an ideal learing setting. The candidate will contribute to understanding how neural networks extract the most relevant information of the data to make a prediction using advanced mathematical tools. This insight opens the door for enjoying the real world. The candidate further develops efficient and robust algorithms for realistic settings in terms of data and computing resources and collaborates to address major challenges in important applications including marine domain and neuroscience. The candidate is expected to assist in supervising students at both master's and PhD levels."
