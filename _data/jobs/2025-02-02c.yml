details: "The DSTrain programme will facilitate ground-breaking research by emphasising interaction between data science, computational science, natural sciences, and technology. The postdoctoral fellows will be integrated in research groups across scientific disciplines where there is an urgent need for computationally skilled researchers. The research groups provide excellent research environments and supervision enabling world-class research, innovation and digital infrastructure, models for interdisciplinary collaboration and training in research, including computational and transferable skills. The DSTrain program also includes a range of cross-sectorial secondments opportunities."
