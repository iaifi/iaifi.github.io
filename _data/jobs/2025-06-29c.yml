details: "â€‹The newly established National Science Foundation (NSF)-Simons CosmicAI Institute seeks to hire a postdoctoral fellow to help initiate a new comprehensive research program to foster foundational advancements in AI through the curation, analysis, and processing of astronomical data at the NSF NOIRLab, located in Tucson, Arizona. The postdoctoral fellow will lead a project on the curation and analysis of multi-epoch time-domain training data for real-time classification algorithms in the context of alert brokers, such as ANTARES, for the Vera Rubin Observatory and its Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). This work will be carried out in close collaboration with CosmicAI team members at various institutions, including NOIRLab (Tom Matheson), SLAC (Adam Bolton), and the University of Virginia (Maryam Modjaz). Although stationed at NSF NOIRLab, CosmicAI fellows will have full access to Institute facilities and equipment (e.g., world-class computational resources at the Texas Advanced Computing Center, including Vista, a newly instantiated 600 GPU node cluster) and routinely collaborate with Institute members across all sites to facilitate the development of cutting-edge AI tools and methodologies."
