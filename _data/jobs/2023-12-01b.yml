details: 'The Johns Hopkins University’s Department of Computer Science invites applications for tenure-track faculty positions. We anticipate making multiple offers across all areas of Computer Science and at all ranks. We will also offer an Early Action application option. This year’s search begins a large-scale expansion of the Whiting School of Engineering, with the goal of adding 150 new tenure-track professors at all ranks, of which 80 will be part of the new Artificial Intelligence Institute. This expansion will include a new building and extensive computational resources that will establish Johns Hopkins as a leading engineering school with a top AI research program. The new Institute will pursue broad applications of AI for the betterment of society, including in health, scientific discovery, autonomy, climate, and sustainability, in addition to research on the fundamentals and foundations of AI. As part of this expansion, the Department of Computer Science will experience substantial growth across all research areas to become one of the largest departments at a private University.'
