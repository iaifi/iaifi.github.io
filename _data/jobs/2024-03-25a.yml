details: This is a fixed-term position for up to 3 years. This postdoctoral fellowship position based in the School of Mathematics and Physics will play a lead role in developing crop trait prediction solutions based on physics informed machine learning to allow accurate predictions by combining physical knowledge and data. Methods will include use of deterministic crop models to generate training data for PIML, and testing against observed datasets. In addition to AAGI, this position will service research needs of other UQ and GRDC supported projects.
