details: "Yale’s Institute for Foundations of Data Science (FDS) is seeking applications for postdoctoral positions in Data Science. These will be generously supported postdoctoral positions, expected to last 2-3 years, for independent scholars working on the foundations of data science. FDS postdocs can select multiple mentors from among the members of the institute, and can change their mentors during their fellowship. This is an opportunity to work with leading theorists as well as domain scientists who are eager to collaborate. A list of the members may be found on our web page, fds.yale.edu. Yale’s Data Science Initiative has supported the rapid growth of the departments of Statistics & Data Science and Computer Science, as well as many interdisciplinary activities in which the postdocs could participate, including a Data Intensive Social Science Center, a center for Biomedical Data Science, and the Schmidt Program on Artificial Intelligence, Emerging Technologies, and National Power."
