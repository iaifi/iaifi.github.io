details: "Basis is a nonprofit applied AI research organization with two mutually reinforcing goals.<br><Br>The first is to understand and build intelligence. This entails establishing the mathematical principles of reasoning, learning, decision-making, understanding, and explaining, and constructing software that embodies these principles.<br><br>The second is to advance societyâ€™s ability to solve intractable problems. This involves expanding the scale, complexity, and breadth of problems we can solve today and, more importantly, accelerating our ability to solve problems in the future.<br><Br>To achieve these goals, we are building both a new technological foundation inspired by human reasoning, and a new type of collaborative organization that prioritizes human value.<br><br>Research interns work closely with scientists and engineers at Basis, both learning from and contributing to our team. Internships are open to graduate-level candidates (or equivalent), pursuing research in technical and scientific domains, including areas of computer science, such as machine learning, and programming languages.<br><br>We are looking for people who want to grow technically, and who value gaining a deeper understanding of concepts at their foundations."
