details: "â€‹The Theoretical High Energy Physics group at Northeastern University in Boston has a Fall 2026 opening for a Postdoctoral Research Associate to work with the recently established Simons Collaboration on the Physics of Learning (physicsoflearning.org). The Simons Collaboration is harnessing the fundamental sciences to break AI out of its black box using techniques from mathematics and theoretical physics. The postdoctoral researcher will be under the supervision of Prof. Jim Halverson. The successful candidate is expected to contribute to the scientific mission of the collaboration, bringing their technical expertise to bear on problems in AI. Proposals for new scientific directions are welcomed, and the researcher will have an opportunity to collaborate with anyone in the Collaboration. The successful candidate will also have the opportunity to interact and collaborate with the NSF AI Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions (IAIFI), where Halverson is also a PI. If interested, they will be able to apply for Junior Investigator status at IAIFI."
