details: "​The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at Tufts University invites applications for tenure-track faculty positions in Electrical and Computer Engineering to begin in September 2026/7. We are seeking candidates at the rank of Assistant, Associate, or Full Professor. Over the last three years, the ECE department has recruited four new tenure-stream faculty and added two new teaching-track faculty. Halligan Hall, home to the department’s labs, meeting spaces, and offices, has undergone a $26 million renovation, enabling synergistic co-location of research and teaching spaces. This search is part of a multi-year hiring plan with additional searches planned for the years to follow. These searches are looking for the best candidates broadly in Electrical and Computer Engineering with some example areas of interest listed below. This search is also part of a wider hiring campaign by the School of Engineering (SOE) to grow its research and educational capabilities in contemporary and emergent science and engineering domains.  Overall, we are looking for the best candidates to add to our dynamic and growing department with a strong background in electrical or computer engineering, or a closely related field."
