details: "​Applicants are invited for the posts of Postdoctoral Research Associate or Research Fellow in Machine Learning to work with AI Researchers in the Centre for AI Fundamentals at the University of Manchester. You will join a team of probabilistic modellers and machine learning researchers developing new collaborative AI principles and methods. This is an exciting topic which inspires new problems in fundamental ML work, and allows attacking new applications which make a difference, for instance in scientific research. Different team members have different expertise, and by working together are able to address more novel problems. Keywords include: automatic experimental design, Bayesian inference, human-in-the-loop learning, machine teaching, privacy-preserving learning, reinforcement learning, inverse reinforcement learning, computational rationality and user modelling, and simulator-based inference."
