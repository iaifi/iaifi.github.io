details: "​We invite applications for a Postdoctoral Researcher to join our team and work on EXCALIBUR, a Horizon Europe-funded project focused on applying advanced AI technologies in the cultural heritage (CH) domain. EXCALIBUR utilizes the European Collaborative Cloud for Cultural Heritage (ECCCH) infrastructure to develop innovative tools and methods for creating digital twins (DTs) of cultural heritage objects from burial excavations and related documentation. These DTs enhance the study, conservation, and restoration of cultural heritage context held in European collections or museums. By bridging gaps in research, practice, and stakeholder engagement, EXCALIBUR transforms how bioarchaeological findings are studied and shared, connecting them with artefacts, sites, and burial traditions to deepen understanding of past populations and support the ECCCH’s vision."
