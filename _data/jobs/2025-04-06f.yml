details: "​PIBBSS is an interdisciplinary research organization that supports research from basic science with the potential to make an outsized impact in AI Safety. We're currently seeking affiliates and collaborators for a new direction from our horizon scanning team: Renormalization for AI Safety. This agenda explores how ideas from theoretical physics and complex systems—particularly renormalization—can shed light on the scaling behavior, feature representations, and phase transitions in AI systems. If you're interested in contributing to foundational work at the intersection of physics, complex systems, and AI alignment, we’d love to hear from you.
