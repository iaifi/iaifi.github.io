details: 'MEnTorEd Opportunities in Research (METEOR), is a postdoctoral fellowship program sponsored by MIT CSAIL to support exceptional researchers in computer science and artificial intelligence and to broaden participation in the field. Fellows conduct cutting-edge research as part of a vibrant community and are hosted by research groups with synergistic scientific interests. The goal of METEOR is to enable outstanding individuals to do research in the lab and prepare for careers in academia or industry. The program also features in-depth opportunities for mentorship from researchers in both CSAIL and industry. Postdoctoral researchers selected are awarded a one-year funded appointment (renewable for a second year.) This is a multi-year program, which is hoped to grow and broaden beyond CSAIL.'
