details: "​The lab of Constantin Rothkopf (https://www.pip.tu-darmstadt.de/) at the Centre for Cognitive Science @ TU Darmstadt has several open positions at the PhD and Postdoc levels. Research in the laboratory focuses on explaining human sequential visuomotor decisions and behavior under the influence of the world's uncertainties and ambiguities through computational modeling. Using the reverse-engineering approach, we devise algorithms for inferring individuals' internal models of the world, tracking their subjective beliefs over time during behavior and learning, as well as their internal subjective costs and benefits, including effort. We investigate naturalistic sequential tasks, including navigation and object manipulation, active learning and active sensing, sequential decision-making under uncertainty, and intuitive physics. The lab has state-of-the-art equipment for eye and body tracking, VR, naturalistic task monitoring, psychophysics, and access to one of the most generous computing infrastructures in Germany. A large-scale tracking lab will be available in 2026."
