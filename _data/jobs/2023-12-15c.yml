details: 'The Computer Science area of the John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) and the Kempner Institute for the Study of Natural and Artificial Intelligence at Harvard University are seeking applicants for a tenure-track or tenured position specializing in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, with an expected start date of July 1, 2024. We are particularly interested in candidates with strong foundations in deep learning, generative AI, foundational models, and LLMs, with interest to apply these technologies to one or more domains including computational biology and the sciences, NLP, and computer vision. The successful candidate will be expected to lead an innovative research program that advances our understanding of and increases innovation in AI and ML, encompassing the development of new methodologies and models.
Candidates will be welcomed into an interdisciplinary and highly collaborative environment where exploration into how principles of computation and learning in artificial systems can aid in understanding the brain and, reciprocally, how insights into brain computation can enhance artificial systems is encouraged. The successful candidate will hold a faculty position in SEAS and be appointed as an Institute Investigator within the Kempner Institute.'
