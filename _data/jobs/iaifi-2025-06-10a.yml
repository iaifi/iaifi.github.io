details: "The high-energy physics group at Brown University seeks to appoint a postdoctoral research associate. The successful candidate will primarily work with Prof. Matt LeBlanc in support of a new project related to Computational Advances that will Enable Precision Physics at the High Luminosity LHC.<br><br>Maximizing the scientific potential of the enormous datasets from the LHC requires significant computational resources for data acquisition, processing and storage. The need for efficient computing solutions will intensify further during the era of the HL-LHC, when data collection rates will increase by roughly an order of magnitude relative to today. This project aims to enhance the discovery potential of the HL-LHC by facilitating more effective knowledge discovery from its vast dataset. This includes investigating novel lossy compression techniques and their impact on physics analysis, particularly for AI/ML applications, as well as developing advanced methods to improve the efficiency of Monte Carlo event generation; for instance, by addressing challenges posed by negative event weights."
