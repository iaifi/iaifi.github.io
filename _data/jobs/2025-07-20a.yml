details: "​VinUniversity (https://vinuni.edu.vn) is seeking highly motivated candidates for one postdoctoral, one Master’s and one Ph.D. position in the broad areas of machine learning, multimodal learning, and autonomous systems. The research will focus on developing and analyzing novel algorithms in safe and secure machine learning, especially on Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Models, and agent-based environments. Topics of interest include—but are not limited to—pre-training strategies, fine-tuning techniques, bias and fairness, interpretability, adversarial robustness, and alignment in AI systems, with potential applications in sustainability, farming, material discovery, and healthcare.<br><br>These positions are closely co-advised by Khoa Doan (Assistant Professor, CECS) and Nitesh Chawla (Honorary Professor at VinUniversity, Frank M. Freimann Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Notre Dame, and the Founding Director of the Lucy Family Institute for Data and Society). The candidates will have opportunities for collaboration with international partners, including the University of Notre Dame, UIUC, the University of Stuttgart, and MPI. Strong candidates will also be funded to spend a portion of their time at the University of Notre Dame, working closely with Nitesh Chawla and potentially other scholars at Lucy Family Institute for Data & Society.<br><br>Interested applicants are encouraged to send their CV and recent publications to Dr. Khoa D Doan (khoa.dd@vinuni.edu.vn)."
