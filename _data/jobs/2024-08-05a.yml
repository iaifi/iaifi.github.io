details: "This post includes opportunities for both Postdocs in Foundation Models for Science, and Postdoc Fellowships. Postdoc in Foundation Models for Science: We seek exceptional postdoctoral candidates hosted at UCSD Computer Science & Engineering, jointly advised by by Prof. Rose Yu, Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick, Yian Ma and Duncan Watson-Parris to start as soon as possible. The goal of the research is to build new foundation models for scientific discovery that can be the basis of an autonomous scientist. This effort envisions an autonomous scientist possessing the ability to characterize its own uncertainty and skepticism, and use them as drivers to systematically acquire and refine its scientific knowledge bases, in a way that human scientist partners can trust. Postdoc Fellowships: Rose Yu is also recruiting postdocs through CSE Fellows Program and Schmidt AI in Science Postdocs Program. CSE Fellows program has a rolling deadline. Schmidt AI program requires both a Science mentor and a AI mentor."
