details: "​Are you looking to perform innovative research in data science? Are you excited about research informed by real-world needs?  Are you passionate about impacting problems of national importance? If so, consider the possibilities afforded by Sandia's Data Science Fellowship. The S. Scott Collis Fellowship in Data Science seeks applicants with a demonstrated background in the interdisciplinary field of data science. Collis Fellows in Data Science work at the junction of cutting-edge data science techniques and Sandia's national security mission and application space. Data science at Sandia emphasizes the analysis and interpretation of scientific, engineering, and observational (sensor) data, including development of scientific models, pattern identification, prediction, and knowledge extraction.  Relevant analysis techniques range from artificial intelligence to advanced statistical methods, to optimization techniques, to methods designed for specialized hardware, and beyond. Examples of the scientific and engineering applications relevant to Sandia's missions include nuclear deterrence and nonproliferation, numerical modeling and scientific simulation, energy systems and power grid, cyber security, operations research, geospatial analysis, neuromorphic computing, quantum computing, and many other national security domains."
