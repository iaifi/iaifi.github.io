details: 'The primary duty is to develop robust AI techniques to optimize the performance of interferometeric optical systems. This duty entails building a simulation environment and commissioning a table-top experiment to develop and test these techniques and then applying them to solve controls problems in the LIGO detectors and in other optics environments.  May be asked to prepare research narratives for grant proposals and perform other duties as needed.  The work will require interacting with a diverse group of communities--gravitational-wave instrumentalists, AI experts as part of the NSF Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions, and other interested communities in the Boston area such as Lincoln Lab.'
