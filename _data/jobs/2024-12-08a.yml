details: "The CAI group (https://collaborative-ai.org/) conducts fundamental research towards collaborative artificial intelligence at the intersection of multimodal machine learning, computational cognitive modelling, computer vision, and human-machine interaction. We have a strong presence in leading conferences in these research fields and, as such, are among the few truly interdisciplinary groups in Germany and Europe. We are highly visible internationally, and publications from the group are frequently distinguished with best paper awards. So far, out of 14 PhD and PostDoc alumni, seven have assumed faculty positions at leading institutions worldwide, several others have jointed industrial research labs. Close links exist to the International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems (IMPRS-IS) and the local Max Planck Institute, the ELLIS Unit Stuttgart, the Centre for Bionic Intelligence TÃ¼bingen Stuttgart (BITS), as well as several large-scale research projects within the University of Stuttgart."
