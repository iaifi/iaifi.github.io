details: "​The Chapman Schmidt AI in Science Fellows will produce independent and original research, using AI to advance science, within the Maths Department and the I-X Centre for AI in Science. These fellowships have the aim of identifying excellent researchers and accelerating them in using AI to advance and disrupt Science or Engineering. Here ‘AI’ is interpreted very broadly, e.g.: topics in Bayesian Inference and Robotics; ‘Science’ covers any typical topic in Natural Science and Engineering (Epidemiology, Biology and basic science in biomedicine are included but clinical medical themes are not covered, including conventional medical imaging). Examples include Bayesian optimization for molecular or materials design; machine learning for single cell data; physics-based ML for turbine design and astrostatistics. These posts are not suitable for generic AI research with general application: candidates must be aiming to substantially advance a particular area of science. Applicants could view themselves as AI researchers tackling particular pieces of science or science researchers using AI to transform their area. Extensive AI knowledge is not required, and AI training is offered."
