details: "The Laboratory of Intelligent Maintenance and Operations Systems focuses on developing intelligent algorithms to improve performance, reliability and availability of complex infrastructure and industrial assets and making the maintenance more cost efficient. Our research spans a range of cutting-edge techniques, including physics-informed machine learning, domain adaptation, (physics-informed) graph neural networks, and deep reinforcement learning, specifically applied to the unique challenges of complex industrial and infrastructure systems. We work primarily with heterogeneous, multivariate time series data characterized by varying data types, sampling rates, and degrees of uncertainty."
