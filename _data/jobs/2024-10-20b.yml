details: "The NSF-Simons National AI Institute for the Sky (SkAI Institute) invites applications for SkAI Prize Postdoctoral Fellowships. Spurred by the coming generation of large sky surveys, the newly founded SkAI Institute will bring together astrophysics and AI researchers to advance both fields through cross-disciplinary collaboration and will serve as a nexus for the further development of a nationwide Astro-AI community.<br><br>SkAI Fellows will have the opportunity to lead independent research aligned with SkAI’s broad Astro-AI research mission, in collaboration with SkAI Senior Personnel and their research groups. Fellows will be based in the SkAI Hub (Hancock building in downtown Chicago) but will be able to also spend time at any of the SkAI institutional research partners (Northwestern University, University of Chicago, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and many other partners), depending on the Fellows’ research and education interests. They will benefit from a diverse, cross-disciplinary, and dynamic intellectual environment (including workshops, lecture series, conferences, retreats, and more), a structured mentorship program, training opportunities, access to computing resources at NCSA and Argonne National Laboratory suited for AI research and to collaborations with software engineers, and will have opportunities to collaborate with peers and mentor students from SkAI academic partners (including SkAI’s Satellite Network)."
