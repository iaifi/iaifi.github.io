details: "At least 70% of your assignment will be spent on academic research in the field of machine learning. The BioML research group of the Department of Data Analysis and Mathematical Modelling focusses on the development of machine learning methods for the life sciences. Specific research areas of interest are multi-target prediction, sequence learning, time series analysis, uncertainty quantification and probabilistic models. In terms of applications the focus is on analyzing “omics” data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, etc.)."
