details: 'Candidates are expected to have a doctoral degree in computer science or a related field. Successful candidates must have a strong commitment to and demonstrated excellence in teaching. They must show commitment to educating a broad and diverse group of students and to increasing the participation and success of students from groups underrepresented in computer science. Successful candidates at the Associate and Full Professor of the Practice level must also show examples of academic, scholarly, and educational success outside the classroom that have resulted in, or have the potential to result in, significant advancements in computer science education. The term of an initial appointment depends on the rank, but is typically four years for a junior position. Reappointment and promotion are governed by departmental and university bylaws and guidelines that encourage faculty to be innovative, to succeed locally and nationally, and to develop new courses and curricula that mesh with ongoing and new initiatives.
