details: "Are you interested in developing novel machine learning methodologies that are scalable, reliable and explainable and that can address imminent challenges both within quantum physics and the life-sciences?<br><br>As our new colleague your job will be to develop novel computational frameworks for machine learning by use of tensor network representations. In particular, you will push the boundaries of: Scalability, drawing upon recent large-scale TN capabilities in physics; Reliability, exploring uncertainty quantification and robust inference in machine learning; Explainability, leveraging identifiability and unique recovery explored using tensor decompositions within the life-science domain."
