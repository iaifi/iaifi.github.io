details: "​At Nera, we’re building something rare: an AI-native engine that turns messy human business intent into production-grade software. The current generation of tools breaks down in enterprise reality — we’ve seen it firsthand. We believe the future of software is one where people and machines collaborate seamlessly, where enterprises are no longer trapped by brittle vendor lock-in, and where new ideas can become working systems in days, not years. This role is central to that mission. You won’t just build pipelines — you’ll help reimagine how people and AI work together."
