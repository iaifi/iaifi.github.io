details: "Responsible computing involves the ethical, safe, and conscientious use of computer systems, algorithms, data, and data-driven models. We are looking for applicants with a strong background in Computer Science and an excellent research record in responsible computing, as documented by publications in relevant top venues (such as ACM CHI, ACM FAccT, ACM AIES, NeurIPS, ICML, AAAI, the International Journal of Human-Computer Studies or the ACM Journal on Responsible Computing) and by successful acquisition of research grants. We strive to strengthen interdisciplinarity, e.g., at the intersection of computer science and the social sciences, the humanities, or philosophy, and are therefore particularly interested in candidates with demonstrated interest and experience in inter/transdisciplinary research in responsible computing. Relevant research focus areas include, but are not limited to: ethical, affective, environmental or societal aspects of information technology and of the digital transformation, human-centered computing, technology for the public good, critical data studies; interpretability, explainability, and transparency of AI/ML; trustworthy algorithmic decision systems."
