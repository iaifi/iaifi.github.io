details: 'The purpose of the Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships (MSPRF) is to support future leaders in mathematics and statistics by facilitating their participation in postdoctoral research environments that will have maximal impact on their future scientific development. There are two options for awardees: Research Fellowship and Research Instructorship. Awards will support research in areas of mathematics and statistics, including applications to other disciplines. Candidates need a sponsoring scientist and host institution, so if you are interested in applying to work with IAIFI, ask an [IAIFI Senior Investigator](people.html#senior-investigators) to sponsor you or contact [IAIFI Management](mailto:iaifi-management@mit.edu) for help identifying a sponsor.'
