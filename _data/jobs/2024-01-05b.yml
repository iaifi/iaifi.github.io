details: 'Combining machine learning (ML) with physics is a rapidly growing area of research, which has received a tremendous amount of attention in both the physics and ML communities. While much work in this area has focused on applying ML tools to help solve problems in physics, the primary focus of our search is research that leverages and extends methods from physics (e.g., from nonlinear dynamics and statistical physics) to gain a better understanding of how and why ML methods work and/or build novel machine learning approaches that draw on principles from physics. The Department of Physics seeks candidates who have the potential or demonstrated ability to build a vibrant research program that pushes the frontiers of science to advance both physics and ML. Our emphasis will be to add to our existing strengths in nonlinear dynamics and statistical physics, but we welcome exceptional candidates who draw on and expand any area of physics in order to understand and advance machine learning capabilities.'
