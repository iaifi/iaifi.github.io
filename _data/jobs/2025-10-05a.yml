details: "â€‹The Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Fellowship Program at the University of Chicago is seeking scholars who seek to advance and accelerate the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in the natural sciences. The rise of AI in science and engineering presents both a remarkable opportunity and a profound challenge to human-centered modes of inquiry, including not only data analysis, but also the design of experiments, the formulation of new hypotheses, and the revelation of natural laws. Given the cross-disciplinary nature of AI research in science, Fellows will be offered freedom and independence in pursuing their AI-related research, including the flexibility to change or expand their research focus and to work with multiple research groups while at the University."
