details: "â€‹The University of Chicago is implementing an ambitious plan for research and education in Data Science and AI, including new academic programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels and new cross-disciplinary research programs. The Data Science Institute (datascience.uchicago.edu) is a collaboration among the Department of Computer Science (cs.uchicago.edu), the Department of Statistics (stat.uchicago.edu), and other units on campus. Topics of interest include foundations and applications of artificial intelligence, machine learning, large language models, scientific AI and machine learning, data ethics and privacy, data visualization, societal impact of data and AI, safe and trustworthy AI, data engineering, scalable data systems, and high-dimensional statistical inference. We encourage applications from all researchers focused on developing the foundations and practice of Data Science as an emerging field. The Data Science Institute focuses on research that advances fundamental theories at the intersection of data science, artificial intelligence, statistics, and computing in the context of real-world and domain-specific problems. The Committee on Data Science (codas.uchicago.edu) is the home of data science education programs. The larger data science community at the University of Chicago includes the Committee on Computational and Applied Mathematics (cam.uchicago.edu), the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago (TTIC), the Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation, Fermilab, and Argonne National Laboratory."
