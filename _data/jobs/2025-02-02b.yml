details: "The Department of Statistical Science at UCL is the longest established university statistics department in the world and has played a pioneering role in the development of the subject since its foundation in 1911. It is one of nine departments in the UCL Faculty of Mathematical and Physical Sciences and has close links with many other departments, both within the Faculty and outside of it. We teach statistical science at all levels (undergraduate single/combined honours, service courses, MSc and PhD) and carry out research across a wide range of theoretical and applied areas. In the last Research Excellence Framework exercise (2021/22), over 97% of our output was classified as “world-leading” or “internationally excellent” in terms of originality, significance and rigour. We consistently score highly in the National Student Survey in the Postgraduate Taught Experience Survey."
