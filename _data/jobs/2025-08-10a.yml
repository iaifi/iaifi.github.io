details: "​Applications are invited for a postdoctoral research position in the Department of Physics at the National University of Singapore, in the research group of Assistant Professor Marc Hon. The successful candidate will develop and apply modern machine learning methods to the analysis of large-scale astronomical datasets, with a particular emphasis on time-domain astronomy. Research directions will be flexible and shaped according to mutual interests. Potential areas include — but are not limited to — stellar variability, exoplanets, transient phenomena, and the discovery of new astrophysical events. Projects may make extensive use of archival data from major facilities, including NASA’s Kepler, TESS, and JWST missions; ESA’s Gaia mission; and large-scale spectroscopic surveys such as LAMOST. Experience working with large, complex datasets is expected, and familiarity with modern machine learning methods will be considered an asset."
