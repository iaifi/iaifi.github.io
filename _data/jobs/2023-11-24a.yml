details: 'The School of Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh is pleased to invite applications for the 2023 Flora Philip Fellowship. This four-year Fellowship is specifically aimed at promising early-career postdoctoral researchers from backgrounds that are under-represented in the mathematical sciences academic community (e.g. gender, minority ethnicity, disability, disadvantaged circumstances, etc.).  The Fellowship aims to provide a supportive and collegial environment for early-career researchers to develop their research and prepare themselves, with support from an academic mentor, for future independent roles in academia and beyond. The starting salary will be at a junior faculty level (Lecturer or Assistant Professor, Grade UE8). The post is available either on a full-time or part-time basis.'
