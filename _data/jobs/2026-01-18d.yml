details: "​The logic and learning (LOL) group is recruiting a postdoc funded by ELLIS institute Finland. You will work with Associate Professor Andrew Cropper. We work on combining logical reasoning and machine learning. We focus on inductive logic programming (ILP), which learns logical rules from data. We primarily use automated reasoning techniques, such as SAT/ASP/SMT/MaxSAT solvers, to learn rules from data."
