details: "​Applications are invited for two-year Fields Postdoctoral Fellowship positions with the research program on Mathematics for AI Safety, a joint initiative of the Fields Institute for Research in Mathematical Sciences and the Principles of Intelligence (PrincInt: https://princint.ai/), housed within the Fields Institute's Centre for Mathematical AI. The fellowships support research at the intersection of mathematics and AI safety, with a focus on developing rigorous mathematical foundations for AI interpretability. Research directions include mean field theories of deep learning, data attribution methods, renormalization group approaches to neural networks, learning-theoretic analysis of algorithms and geometric analysis of the learning landscape. Candidates are encouraged to interpret these subject areas broadly."
