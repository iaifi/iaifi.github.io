details: "We invite applications for a 3 year Post-Doctoral Research Associate position at Lancaster University to join the Prob_AI Hub. The vision of the Prob_AI Hub is to develop a world-leading, diverse and UK-wide research programme in probabilistic AI. The hub will develop the next generation of mathematically-rigorous, scalable and uncertainty-aware AI algorithms. This will be achieved through: bringing together world-leading researchers across Applied Mathematics, Computer Science, Probability and Statistics, who engage with a range of non- academic partners; transforming the people pipeline; and producing a culture change within the mathematical sciences more broadly, so that cross-disciplinary mathematics research in AI is the norm."
