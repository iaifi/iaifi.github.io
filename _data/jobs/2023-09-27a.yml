details: 'The School of Physics is seeking to appoint a Senior Lecturer or Lecturer in Complex Systems. This is a continuing 40% (teaching), 40% (research) and 20% (service) position. Complex Systems is a research strength of the School, having been a node of four Commonwealth-funded research centers and two University centers in the last decade, with strong cross-Faculty, national, and international links. We seek an appointee with strong theoretical, mathematical, and computational ability with a track record of applications to modeling and analyzing complex physical systems.
It is anticipated that the appointee will grow their research program while contributing to the Schoolâ€™s undergraduate and postgraduate teaching and training in Physics, including especially its interdisciplinary links. We are seeking to recruit a mid-career academic to both strengthen and complement existing research strengths of the group, while expanding into new areas as appropriate.'
