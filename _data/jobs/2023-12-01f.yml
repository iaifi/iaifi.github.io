details: 'MITâ€™s Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research invites applications for a postdoctoral position to work in the group of Prof. Lina Necib on galactic dynamics and dark matter research. The appointment is for 2 years, with a third-year contingent upon performance. The start date is flexible within Fall 2024. The successful candidate will analyze cosmological simulations and stellar catalogs with focus on Gaia and LSST, to better understand the local dynamics of the Milky Way and deduce properties of dark matter. The postdoctoral researcher might also run cosmological simulations, and use machine learning methods to extract information from available data sets. They will have substantial freedom to suggest and work on projects related to stellar dynamics and dark matter. Applicants must have a PhD in physics, astrophysics, or a closely related field by the start of the position. Expertise in data analysis and computing are required. The successful applicant must have the ability to carry out an independent research program, and work collaboratively with students and other members of the MKI community. Experience with cosmological simulations and/or stellar catalogs as well as machine learning is preferred but not required.'
