details: 'The University of Southampton is looking for someone who can support and build our research and education programmes in theoretical physics and/or astrophysics with a focus on computational applications. This can range from developing simulations of the physics of the universe on small or large scales to modelling physical processes or applying advanced computing techniques to large/complex data sets to reveal the underlying physical structure. Current examples of computing expertise in Physics and Astronomy include Lattice Gauge Theory, Quantum Simulations of QFT, radiation hydrodynamical/radiative transfer simulations, machine learning/AI for large-scale sky surveys, and galactic-scale population synthesis modelling.'
