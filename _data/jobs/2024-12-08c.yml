details: "The newly established NSF-Simons CosmicAI Institute seeks to hire an outstanding Postdoctoral Fellow specializing in AI with a focus on Explainable and Interpretable AI (XAI) methods. The Fellow will play a key role in advancing research efforts aimed at creating innovative AI techniques, with a particular focus on causal inference with AI and symbolic modeling tailored for complex data analysis in astronomy. The Fellow, based at the University of Texas at Austin, will work closely with Dr. Arya Farahi and Dr. Alessandro Rinaldo at the Department of Statistics and Data Sciences and will collaborate with researchers across the Institute to facilitate the development of cutting-edge AI tools and methodologies. While collaboration with natural scientists (such as astronomers and physicists) is encouraged, a background in these fields is not required. We are seeking candidates with expertise in AI methodologies such as causal inference or symbolic modeling and an interest in interdisciplinary collaboration. The Fellow will have access to cutting-edge computational resources, including Vista, a 600-GPU node cluster at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC)."
