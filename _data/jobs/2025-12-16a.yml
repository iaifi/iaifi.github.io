details: "​We're excited to announce the 5th iteration of the PIBBSS Summer Research Fellowship program! Principles of Intelligence (PIBBSS) is a research initiative focused on supporting AI safety research that brings knowledge from less-explored fields and brings both knowledge and researchers to AI Alignment. In Summer 2026, our Fellowship will bring together researchers from a variety of fields. Over 3 months, Fellows will work on a project at the intersection of their field and AI safety, under the mentorship of experienced AI alignment researchers. The fellowship will be hosted in London. Our alumni have gone on to work in academia, AI Safety labs, UK AISI, or started independent research, among others."
