details: "​The Distinguished Staff Fellowship (DSF) program offers outstanding early career scientists and engineers a unique and prestigious entry to a career at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Of more than 7,000 staff, just a select few are DSFs. Fellowship highlights include:<br>- Freedom to explore research interests: Our Fellows are encouraged to explore new lines of scientific discovery while also pursuing their proposed work and participating in ongoing Laboratory projects. Along the way, they make a big impact, often developing new lab capabilities and programs.<br>- Funding security: The fellowship offers 3 years of guaranteed funding with assistance from divisions to identify funding and research opportunities to position them for successful roll-off.<br>- Long-term employment opportunity: We envision that our DSFs will pursue a long-term career at ORNL and strive to provide an experience that supports this. The Office of Research Education, which administers the DSF program, works with hiring divisions to support our fellows’ needs and implements programming to build a strong community among current and alumni DSFs.<br>And more!"
