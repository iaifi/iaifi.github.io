details: "â€‹Applications are invited for a Postdoctoral Research Fellow position in the Institute for Theory and Computation (ITC) at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. One of the primary objectives of the ITC is to integrate conceptual theory with computational modeling. We are, therefore, interested in candidates working in any field related to theoretical and/or numerical astrophysics. The successful candidate will have access to our new computing facilities and will have the opportunity to interact and work with researchers in both the Harvard College Observatory (HCO) and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO)."
