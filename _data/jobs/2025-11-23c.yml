details: "​The INFN Genova high-energy phenomenology group is seeking applications for a two-year postdoctoral position in particle physics, with a focus on precision machine learning and its applications to particle phenomenology. The group (Biggio, Frixione, Marzani, Ridolfi, Torre) has broad interests in collider physics, effective field theories, higher-order calculations, parton distribution functions, and new physics searches, both within and beyond the Standard Model. It maintains close interactions with local experimental groups involved in ATLAS, CMS, LHCb, and astroparticle physics, and has several ongoing projects with international collaborators. The successful candidate is expected to contribute to the activities of the INFN initiative PML4HEP – Precision Machine Learning for High-Energy Physics, coordinated from Genova. Research topics may include the development and validation of ML-based tools for simulation, inference, or modeling; generative models for collider physics; likelihood-free inference; global EFT fits; and uncertainty quantification in ML. Candidates with a background in theoretical or phenomenological particle physics, and an interest in machine learning techniques, are encouraged to apply."
