details: We are seeking postbaccalaureate research fellows to join our interdisciplinary teams of scientists and engineers to develop and deploy artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate science discoveries in particle physics, astrophysics, biology, and neuroscience. We strongly encourage women and individuals from traditionally underrepresented groups in STEM, such as African American/Black, Chicano/Latino, Native American/Alaska Native, Native Hawaiin/Pacific Islander, and Filipino, to apply. Postbacc fellows will work together with mentors to develop deep learning algorithms applied to either gravitational-wave detector such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory or the Large Hadron Collider to discover new physics events. Additionally students, have the possibility to explore optimized and create their own deep learning architectures.
