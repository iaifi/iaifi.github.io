details: "​This postdoctoral position is full-time and fixed-term for 36 months with the possibility of renewal thereafter. You will be based in Oxford as your normal place of work with the possibility of hybrid work within the UK only. We are looking for a candidate interested in developing their own research questions in alignment with the interests and skills present in the research team. We are particularly interested in investigating how modern privacy-enhancing technologies (e.g. based upon synthetic data or using formal differential privacy guarantees) impact research integrity and reproducibility. This is an exciting line of research with potential to not only improve how researchers access crucial sensitive data around the world, but also build tools for them to understand if the anonymised data they receive is “good enough” to conduct rigorous research."
