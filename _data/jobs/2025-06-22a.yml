details: "​We are seeking a highly motivated and talented individual to join our dynamic and international research team and contribute to cutting-edge research in the interdisciplinary field of Social Bias Analysis and Understanding (over time and across different languages) using Natural Language Processing techniques (particularly, Large Language Models). The focus of the research will be on, firstly, processing of data (especially political debates and social media) over time (1950s-2020s) and across different languages (German, English, Italian, Czech). Secondly, we will develop manual and automatic, LLM-based annotation schemes in order to infer fine-grained social biases, e.g., relating to gender and migration status in the data. Thirdly, we will explore how biases have evolved in the four languages mentioned and over time. The project is part of the “HistoBias” DFG research grant and will involve two further PhD/postdoctoral students supervised by Prof. Simone Ponzetto (University of Mannheim) and Prof. Daniela Grunow (Goethe University Frankfurt), respectively."
