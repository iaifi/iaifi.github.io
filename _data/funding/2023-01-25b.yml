details: The objective of PAARE is to improve the quality and environment of astronomy and astrophysics research and education by stimulating the development of formal, long-term partnerships that provide authentic pathways into the research enterprise and broaden the participation of individuals from groups underrepresented in astronomy. Partnerships must substantially involve institutions seeking to create opportunities for student and faculty research that will increase the recruitment, retention, and success of these individuals. It is expected that the partnerships will build or strengthen research capacity, as well as foster a diverse, inclusive, and equitable environment for astronomy and astrophysics research and education at the partnering institutions.
