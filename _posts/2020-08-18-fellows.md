title: IAIFI Fellows 2020 Competition
---

IAIFI Fellows will spark interdisciplinary and multi-investigator collaborations, generate new ideas and approaches, translate physics challenges beyond their native domains, and help develop a common language across disciplines.

AI technologies are advancing rapidly, making it both important and challenging to train junior researchers at the intersection of physics and AI. The IAIFI aims to recruit and train a talented, promising, and diverse group of researchers at an early stage of their careers, including at the postdoctoral level through a new IAIFI Fellows Program.  

“Our Fellows program is modeled after the highly successful [MIT Pappalardo Fellows in Physics](https://web.mit.edu/physics/research/pappalardo/index.html)”, says MIT Professor of Physics Marin Soljacic, himself a former Pappalardo Fellow. “Currently, many students who are interested in AI go directly to industry after obtaining a PhD. By offering them their choice of research problems, and the chance to focus on cutting-edge challenges in fundamental interactions, we will be able to further the training of many talented young scientists.  This program will provide a truly unique opportunity.”

Nominations for the inaugural group of IAIFI Fellows are due in early October. See our [Fellows](/fellows.html) page for more information.
