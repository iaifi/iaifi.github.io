## News from IAIFI Management

### Mentorship Resources from the IAIFI Universities
The ECEC has compiled a list of various [mentorship resources](https://iaifi.org/ecec.html#mentorship-resources) from the IAIFI universities, ranging from mentor and mentee handbooks to workshops. We encourage you to take a look and see if any of the resources would be helpful for you in any of your mentor-mentee relationships; the majority of the resources are publicly accessible to people at any university. If you think any more resources should be added to the list, feel free to submit ideas through the [IAIFI feedback form](https://forms.gle/hk2mrqjaLY8nCZrE6).  

### UMass Boston Quantum Day on Friday, May 2, 2025
In celebration of the “International Year of Quantum Science and Technology” the Department of Physics at UMass Boston will be hosting its Third Annual Research Symposium with a theme of ‘Quantum Collaborations.’ This event will include speakers from both academia and industry, showcasing collaborative efforts by UMB Physics faculty with leaders from academia and industry. This will be a great opportunity to learn more about the history and ‘magic’ of quantum physics, explore new research advances by UMB faculty and collaborators, and connect with experts shaping the future of the field.
 
**The afternoon (2:00-5:00pm) will feature the IAIFI-UMB partnership and will include presentations from IAIFI members. If you would like to attend and need IAIFI to help coordinate a ride, [please RSVP here](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/0196361febea76e7812e88695b1c36d6).**
