## News from IAIFI Management

### Computing Resource Opportunities: NERSC and NAIRR Pilot 
The IAIFI Computing Committee is spotlighting two potential avenues for additional project resources. 
1. [NERSC](https://www.nersc.gov/research-and-development/data-analytics/aiml/nersc-ai-for-science-cfp-2025/): NERSC invites proposals for projects that will leverage our supercomputer Perlmutter to push the state of the art in AI for science and produce novel science outcomes. They are specifically seeking teams with expertise using deep learning for science, a deep understanding of the scientific domain, and demonstrated proof of concepts. **Please note that proposals are being reviewed on a rolling basis.** 
2. [NAIRR Resource Pilot](https://www.nsf.gov/focus-areas/artificial-intelligence/nairr): Led by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) in partnership with 12 other federal agencies and 26 non-governmental partners, the pilot makes available government-funded, industry and other contributed resources in support of the nation's research and education community.  

We encourage you to look into these resources to determine if they are applicable for your work at IAIFI!
