## News from IAIFI Management
 
### Thank You and Have a Good Summer!

Thank you for an excellent semester in IAIFI! Since January, we as a community have held **8 journal clubs**, **5 public colloquia**, **4 industry lunches**, **3 thematic discussions**, **2 workshops on mentorship and science communications**, **1 research panel on the 2024 Nobel Prize**, and spent **50 hours networking** through coffee hours, co-working sessions, and social events. Our committees have also been hard at work: below are just some of the highlights from each committee as well as details about talks we hosted so you can catch up on any you may have missed.

* **Community Building Committee**: Kicked off monthly Co-working Sessions for the IAIFI community, organized the Spring Social at the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing, and rolled out a system for IAIFI members to propose and get reimbursed for organizing community-building activites. **If you're interested in submitting an idea for an event, [fill out the form here!](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/11c9f5109efc4abd907ccde4a5d3d37e)**
