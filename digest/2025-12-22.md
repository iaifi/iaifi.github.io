## News from IAIFI Management

Thank you for an excellent semester in IAIFI! Since September, we as a community have held **12 journal clubs**, **6 public colloquia**, and **2 industry lunches**, as well as an **IAIFI Mini Symposium**, **Junior Member Poster Session**, **Thematic Discussion on Diffusion in collaboration with Harvard SEAS**, and an **IAIFI Fellows Showcase**. We also spent **40 hours networking** through coffee hours, co-working sessions, and social events. Our Forums and Committees have been hard at work: below are just some of the highlights from each group as well as details about talks we hosted so you can catch up on any you may have missed.

* **Research Forum**: Began developing an IAIFI blog where researchers can post write-ups on their published papers. This will be launched in early 2026!
* **Talent Forum**: Participated in educational events including MIT's [Splash](https://esp.mit.edu/learn/Splash/index.html), started to plan a potential IAIFI Industry Day in 2026, and organized an educational talk with a high school AI Research Club. 
* **Community Forum**: Organized IAIFI's Fall Social, participated in public engagement events such as the [Cambridge Science Festival](https://cambridgesciencecarnival.org/), and collaborated with YouTube channel ScienceClic on a [video about *The Physics of AI*.](https://youtu.be/dRkehLL19Wo?si=0J-6Sw5PhUq5n5ei)

* **Ethical and Social Responsibility Committee**: Held a Town Hall meeting in September 2025 and reviewed and triaged the community's feedback and ideas; as well as organized an [ethics-themed Journal Club talk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SgBfQICSFgXm2Y93xuPXqowTpGefnwP0/view?usp=sharing). 
* **Speaker Selection Committee**: Hosted [six colloquia](https://iaifi.org/events.html#fall-2025) with speakers from across AI and Physics, including one colloquium co-hosted with the Kempner Institute, and one co-hosted with MIT CSAIL.
* **Summer School and Workshop Committee**: Currently planning IAIFI's 2026 Summer School and Workshop, which will be held in Boston/Cambridge, MA (exact location TBA). The [2026 IAIFI Summer School](https://iaifi.org/phd-summer-school.html) will be held August 3–7, 2026 and the [2026 IAIFI Summer Workshop](https://iaifi.org/summer-workshop.html) will be held August 10-14, 2026.
