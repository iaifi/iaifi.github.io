### 2026â€“2029 IAIFI Fellowship Applications Now Open

Applications for the 2026-2029 IAIFI Postdoctoral Fellowship program are now open! Applications are due on **Wednesday, October 8, 2025**. Please share with anyone you think may be interested in applying.

IAIFI seeks a talented and interdisciplinary group of researchers at an early stage of their careers to join the IAIFI Fellowship program. The role of an IAIFI Fellow is to spark vital interdisciplinary, multi-investigator, multi-subfield collaborations across the primary IAIFI domains of **theoretical physics, experimental physics, astrophysics, and foundational AI**. Such collaborations have immense power to generate new ideas and approaches in both physics and AI, to facilitate abstracting physics challenges beyond their native domains to inform the development of cutting-edge AI tools, and to instill a common language across disciplines.
