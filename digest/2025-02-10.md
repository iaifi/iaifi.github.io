### Friday February 14: Grad Student and Postdoc Networking Hour with Colloquium Speakers

This Friday, IAIFI graduate students and postdocs are invited to attend an informal, catered networking hour with IAIFI's colloquium speaker [Sam Bright-Thonney (IAIFI Postdoctoral Fellow)](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1706736), as well as [Peter Stone (Professor, University of Texas at Austin)](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~pstone/), who is the MIT Physics Department's colloquium speaker for the week. This event will be on Friday February 14 from 11:30 AM to 12:30 PM in the IAIFI Penthouse (MIT 26-648), and sandwiches and refreshments will be provided.
 
You can see the details for [Sam’s February 14 colloquium here](https://iaifi.org/events.html), and the details for [Peter’s February 13 colloquium here](https://physics.mit.edu/events/david-and-edith-harris-physics-colloquium-series/). This will be a great opportunity to speak with Sam before the IAIFI colloquium, and to connect with Peter after his MIT Physics Department colloquium.
