### Upcoming IAIFI Events

#### IAIFI Summer Student Showcase and Pizza Lunch (Friday, August 1)
On Friday, August 1, we will host an informal showcase for IAIFI's summer students through the MIT Summer Research Program (MSRP) and the Research Science Institute (RSI)! The students will present posters about their work over the summer, and food and refreshments will be provided. This will be a great opportunity to celebrate the work that the students have done. This will take place on Friday, August 1 at 12:00pm at the IAIFI Penthouse.

#### IAIFI Summer Social (Wednesday, August 6)
All IAIFI members are invited to the 2025 IAIFI Summer School Social on **Wednesday, August 6, 2025**! The event will start with a Fireside Chat with [Boris Hanin](https://boris-hanin.github.io/) (Princeton) from 5:30-6:30pm, followed by a catered reception hosted by one of our sponsors, [PDT Partners](https://pdtpartners.com/), from 6:30-8:00pm.
