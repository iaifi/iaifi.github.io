### Thank You and Happy Holidays!

Thank you for an excellent semester in IAIFI! Since September, we as a community have held **11 journal clubs**, **5 public colloquia**, **2 thematic discussions**, **1 fireside chat**, **1 workshop with UMass Boston**, **2 industry lunches**, and spent **32 hours networking** through coffee hours, social events, and receptions. Our committees have also been hard at work—below are just some of the highlights from each committee as well as details about talks we hosted so you can catch up on any you may have missed.

* **Early Career and Equity Committee**: Hosted an early career Town Hall in September 2024. You can [view notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nO7lsxDNR4yucmDjn6qja6g2fLPfHqpa8Gzcs6l5Qjc/edit?usp=drive_link) from the Town Hall and [submit anonymous feedback to IAIFI](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1HcWQ5qw4jDWTao00PG8wQAutmih2WIqj2FUyzPOLksc/edit) at any time.
* **Computing Committee**: Began to investigate potential additional computing resources through the [National AI Research Resource (NAIRR)](https://new.nsf.gov/focus-areas/artificial-intelligence/nairr), and regularly monitored IAIFI’s current computing resources. You can submit feedback about IAIFI’s current resources [through this survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfd0WjxCs27yscOFtQuhxxwUWYBIRhHON2Aqoinq_V9z8TaiA/viewform).

* **Public Engagement Committee**: [Participated in the Cambridge Science Festival](https://iaifi.org/outreach.html#cambridge-science-festival), including a “Meet a Scientist" AI+Physics introduction with the Boston Museum of Science, and a booth at the Science Festival Carnival.
* **Community Building and Inclusion Committee**: Most recently, hosted an IAIFI crafts night in the IAIFI Penthouse and a social event at Shy Bird in Kendall Square. In January 2025, the committee plans to roll out a system for IAIFI members to request funding to organize their own small-scale IAIFI community-building events; more info will be provided soon.
* **Speaker Selection Committee**: Hosted [five colloquia](https://iaifi.org/events.html#fall-2024), featuring speakers from across AI and Physics. Also hosted a [Fireside Chat](https://www.youtube.com/live/QkT73q1QjS0?feature=shared) on the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics.
