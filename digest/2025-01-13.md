### Subsidizing Member-led Community Building Activities

Based on feedback weâ€™ve received and your comments at the recent Town Hall, the IAIFI Community Building and Inclusion Committee is excited to introduce a new process to subsidize member-led IAIFI social activities and events.
 
In short, the process works this way:
- Fill out the [IAIFI Activity Proposal form](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/11c9f5109efc4abd907ccde4a5d3d37e) at least two weeks before your proposed community-building activity (the form contains more details on the actual approval and reimbursement process). Example activities: Escape Room, Museum Visit, Kayaking
- Pending approval from the Community Building Committee (within 5 business days), organize and advertise your activity. All activities must be advertised to all of IAIFI, but could be targeted to a subset if desired (e.g., first-year grad students).
- After the event, IAIFI members who participate in the event will receive reimbursement up to $10 per participant (max $250 total) as needed, provided that the actual event is in line with what the Committee approved (e.g., at least 5 IAIFI members attended). 
 
To get started, fill out the [IAIFI Activity Proposal form.]( https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/11c9f5109efc4abd907ccde4a5d3d37e) 
 
More details are provided [on this webpage.](https://iaifi.org/social-activities) 
 
If you have any feedback or questions about the process, please contact the IAIFI Project Management Team at [iaifi-pm@mit.edu](mailto:Iaifi-pm@mit.edu).
