<!--- #### FOR AJO Only

The NSF AI Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions (IAIFI) is one of the inaugural NSF national AI research institutes. The IAIFI will enable physics discoveries and advance foundational AI through the development of novel AI approaches that incorporate first principles from fundamental physics. AI is transforming many aspects of society, including the ways that scientists are pursuing groundbreaking discoveries. For many years, physicists have been at the forefront of applying AI methods to investigate fundamental questions about the Universe. Further progress will require a revolutionary leap in AI, as both the complexity of physics problems and the size of physics datasets continue to grow.

The goal of the IAIFI is to develop and deploy the next generation of AI technologies, based on the transformative idea that artificial intelligence can directly incorporate physics intelligence.  IAIFI researchers will use these new AI technologies to tackle some of the most challenging problems in physics, from precision calculations of the structure of matter, to gravitational wave detection of merging black holes, to the extraction of new physical laws from noisy data. IAIFI researchers will also transfer these technologies to the broader AI community, since trustworthy AI is as important for physics discovery as it is for other applications of AI in society. To cultivate human intelligence, the IAIFI will promote training, education, and outreach at the intersection of physics and AI. In this way, the IAIFI will advance physics knowledge – from the smallest building blocks of nature to the largest structures in the Universe – and galvanize AI research innovation.

#### Call for Nominations

[2021-2024 IAIFI Fellowships Competition: Nomination Form](http://www.iaifi.org/)
{:.info}

Of critical importance to the IAIFI vision is our IAIFI Fellows program, which aims to recruit and train the most talented, promising, and diverse group of researchers at an early stage of their careers. These Fellows will spark vital interdisciplinary, multi-PI, multi-subfield collaborations. Such collaborations have immense power to generate new ideas and approaches, to facilitate abstracting physics challenges beyond their native domains, and to instill a common language across disciplines.  

Our program aims to appoint three new postdoctoral IAIFI Fellows each academic year, for a three-year fellowship term each.  The Fellows will have substantial freedom in choosing their research focus; each fellow will be assigned two mentors – one from Physics and one from AI – to guide their choice of research topic and evaluate their research progress.  The Fellows will receive a competitive salary, as well as $5000/yr discretionary research funds.

Fellows will be selected through an annual competition for which candidates cannot apply directly, but must be nominated by a faculty member or senior researcher within the international community of physics, AI, or related fields.  Nominees should have, or be expected to receive by the 1st of September 2021, a PhD in Physics, Statistics, Computer Science, or a related field.  In addition to the nomination letter, at least two other recommendation letters are required.  Nominees will need to submit a CV, a statement of research interests, and a list of publications.  We strongly encourage that the nominations be initiated before the 1st of October 2020.   **The deadline to receive all the materials (including all the recommendation letters) is the 15th of October 2020.**  Any inquiries about program eligibility should be directed to Professor Marin Soljacic, the IAIFI Fellows Coordinator, at <iaifi-fellows@mit.edu>.

The IAIFI is a joint venture between MIT, Harvard, Northeastern, and Tufts.  Fellows will be officially employed at MIT, but encouraged to collaborate throughout the institute.  MIT is an equal employment opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment and will not be discriminated against on the basis of race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, disability, age, genetic information, veteran status, ancestry, or national or ethnic origin.
