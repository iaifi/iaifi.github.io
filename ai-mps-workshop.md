title: NSF Workshop on the Future of AI and the Mathematical and Physical Sciences
---

The NSF Workshop on the Future of AI and the Mathematical and Physical Sciences will bring together Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) researchers who are successfully integrating AI tools for accelerating true scientific breakthroughs to understand the key challenges, gaps, enablers, and opportunities for MPS research to capitalize on and contribute to this new technology. The Workshop will be a truly interdisciplinary event, with experts from across the scientific fields of MPS discussing shared perspectives, as well as identifying unique goals and challenges. 

* When: March 24–26, 2025
* Where: MIT College of Computing (Building 45), 8th floor (51 Vassar St, Cambridge, MA)
