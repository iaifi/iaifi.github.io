title: IAIFI Affiliates
---

IAIFI affiliates are expected to participate in the life of the institute (see examples below). It is possible to collaborate with IAIFI members without becoming an affiliate. Also, note that if you are a junior member (post-docs, grad students, etc), you do not need to apply to become affiliates. Just ask your supervisor to request an affiliation directly to the IAIFI management.
