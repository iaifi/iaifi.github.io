## Partnership Hub
We are in the process of developing partnerships across both industry and academia. If you are interested in discussing partnership opportunities with IAIFI, [contact Todd Zickler](mailto:zickler@seas.harvard.edu), IAIFI Knowledge Transfer Coordinator. 

IAIFI members can access the internal Partnership Hub, including links to resources and opportunities for collaboration (if you do not have access, [email IAIFI Management](mailto:iaifi@mit.edu).

## IAIFI-AIMLAC Workshop 2022
IAIFI welcomed 15 students and faculty from the [UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning & Advanced Computing (AIMLAC)](http://cdt-aimlac.org) for an informal workshop March 2 through March 4, 2022. The two groups shared research and education strategies, and had opportunities for networking.

The program is shared below. [The slides are available](https://internal.iaifi.org/internal-events/#past-events) to IAIFI members by logging in to the IAIFI internal website.
