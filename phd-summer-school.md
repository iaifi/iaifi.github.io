## About 
The Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions (IAIFI) is enabling physics discoveries and advancing foundational AI through the development of novel AI approaches that incorporate first principles, best practices, and domain knowledge from fundamental physics. The Summer School will include lectures and events that illustrate interdisciplinary research at the intersection AI and Physics, and encourage global networking. Hands-on code-based tutorials that build on foundational lecture materials help students put theory into practice, and a hackathon project provides an opportunity for students to collaborate and apply what they've learned.

## Apply

**Applications are now closed for the 2025 IAIFI Summer School. [Subscribe to our mailing list](http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/iaifi-news) to receive updates on future opportunities.**


## Accommodations
Students for the Summer School have the option to reserve dorm rooms at Harvard University. IAIFI will reimburse the cost of 5 nights in the dorms after the Summer School, contingent upon attendance. Instructions for this will be provided to students upon acceptance.
