## About 
The Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions (IAIFI) is enabling physics discoveries and advancing foundational AI through the development of novel AI approaches that incorporate first principles, best practices, and domain knowledge from fundamental physics. The Summer School will include lectures and events that illustrate interdisciplinary research at the intersection AI and Physics, and encourage global networking. Hands-on code-based tutorials that build on foundational lecture materials help students put theory into practice, and a hackathon project provides an opportunity for students to collaborate and apply what they've learned.

Lecture 1: Elements of Interactive Decision Making (Sasha Rakhlin, MIT)

*Machine learning methods are increasingly deployed in interactive
environments, ranging from dynamic treatment strategies in medicine to
fine-tuning of LLMs using reinforcement learning. In these settings,
the learning agent interacts with the environment to collect data and
necessarily faces an exploration-exploitation dilemma.\\
\\
In this lecture, we’ll begin with multi-armed bandits, progressing
through structured and contextual bandits. We’ll then move on to
reinforcement learning and broader decision-making frameworks,
outlining the key algorithmic approaches and statistical principles
that underpin each setting. Our goal is to develop both a rigorous
understanding of the learning guarantees and a toolbox of fundamental
algorithms.*

Lecture 2: Physics-Guided Optimizations: Inform and Inspire AI Models with Physics Principles (Gaia Grosso, IAIFI Fellow)

*This lecture presents key concepts and techniques for designing machine learning models both informed by and inspired by physics principles. In the first part, we explore ways to inform AI models about physics constraints and data properties. We examine the highly structured nature of data in the physical sciences—such as images, point clouds, and time series—and discuss how their geometric and physical properties shape effective machine learning approaches. We then cover practical strategies for incorporating physical constraints through loss functions, regularization, and inductive biases. In the second part, we highlight how physical principles can inspire the design of optimization methods and AI architectures, introducing concepts like annealing, diffusion, entropy, and energy-based models, and showing examples of their growing role in modern machine learning.*

Lecture 3: Computing with Neural Manifolds: 
A Multi-Scale Framework for Understanding Biological and Artificial Neural Networks (SueYeon Chung, Harvard)

*Recent breakthroughs in experimental neuroscience and machine learning have opened new frontiers in understanding the computational principles governing neural circuits and artificial neural networks (ANNs). Both biological and artificial systems exhibit an astonishing degree of orchestrated information processing capabilities across multiple scales - from the microscopic responses of individual neurons to the emergent macroscopic phenomena of cognition and task functions. At the mesoscopic scale, the structures of neuron population activities manifest themselves as neural representations. Neural computation can be viewed as a series of transformations of these representations through various processing stages of the brain. The primary focus of my lab's research is to develop theories of neural representations that describe the principles of neural coding and, importantly, capture the complex structure of real data from both biological and artificial systems.\\
\\
In this lecture, I will present three related approaches that leverage techniques from statistical physics, machine learning, and geometry to study the multi-scale nature of neural computation. First, I will introduce new statistical mechanical theories that connect geometric structures that arise from neural responses (i.e., neural manifolds) to the efficiency of neural representations in implementing a task. Second, I will employ these theories to analyze how these representations evolve across scales, shaped by the properties of single neurons and the transformations across distinct brain regions. Finally, I will show how these insights extend efficient coding principles beyond early sensory stages, linking representational geometry to efficient task implementations. This framework not only help interpret and compare models of brain data but also offers a principled approach to designing ANN models for higher-level vision. This perspective opens new opportunities for using neuroscience-inspired principles to guide the development of intelligent systems.*

Lecture 4: Domain Shift Problem: Building Robust AI Models with Domain Adaptation (Aleksandra Ciprajanovic, Fermilab)

*Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing physics research—from probing the large-scale structure of the Universe to modeling subatomic interactions and fundamental forces. Yet, a major challenge persists: AI models trained on simulations or old experiment / astronomical survey often perform poorly when applied to new data—exposing issues of dataset (domain) shift, model robustness, and uncertainty in predictions. This summer school session will introduce students to common challenges in applying AI across domains and present solutions based on domain adaptation—a set of techniques designed to improve model generalization under domain shift. We will cover foundational ideas, practical strategies, and current research frontiers in this area. Through examples in astrophysics, we'll explore how domain adaptation can help bridge the gap between synthetic and real-world data, improve trust in model outputs, and advance scientific discovery. The concepts discussed are broadly applicable across physics and other scientific disciplines, making this a valuable topic for anyone interested in building robust, transferable AI models for science.*
