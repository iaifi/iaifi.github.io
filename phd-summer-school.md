## About 
The Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions (IAIFI) is enabling physics discoveries and advancing foundational AI through the development of novel AI approaches that incorporate first principles, best practices, and domain knowledge from fundamental physics. The Summer School will include lectures and events that AI + Physics, illustrate interdisciplinary research at the intersection AI and Physics, and encourage diverse global networking. Hands-on code-based tutorials that build on foundational lecture materials help students put theory into practice.

## Apply

**Applications are closed for the 2024 IAIFI Summer School.


## Accommodations
Students for the Summer School have the option to reserve dorm rooms (at their own expense) at Boston University. Instructions for this will be provided to students upon acceptance.
