## About 
The Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions (IAIFI) is enabling physics discoveries and advancing foundational AI through the development of novel AI approaches that incorporate first principles, best practices, and domain knowledge from fundamental physics. The Summer School will include lectures and events that AI + Physics, illustrate interdisciplinary research at the intersection AI and Physics, and encourage diverse global networking. Hands-on code-based tutorials that build on foundational lecture materials help students put theory into practice.

## Apply

**Applications are closed for the 2024 IAIFI Summer School.**


## Accommodations
Students for the Summer School have the option to reserve dorm rooms (at their own expense) at Boston University. Instructions for this will be provided to students upon acceptance.


### Costs
* There is no registration fee for the Summer School. Students for the Summer School are expected to cover the cost of travel and boarding. 
* Lunch each day, as well as coffee and snacks at breaks, will be provided during the Summer School, along with at least one dinner during the Summer School.

Large-scale quantum reservoir learning with QuEra, Pedro Lopes and Milan Kornjača

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<em>Quantum machine learning has gained considerable attention as quantum technology advances, presenting a promising approach for efficiently learning complex data patterns. Despite this promise, most contemporary quantum methods require significant resources for variational parameter optimization and face issues with vanishing gradients, leading to experiments that are either limited in scale or lack potential for quantum advantage. To address this, we develop a general-purpose, gradient-free, and scalable quantum reservoir learning algorithm that harnesses the quantum dynamics of QuEra's Aquila to process data. Quantum reservoir learning on Aquila, achieves competitive performance across various categories of machine learning tasks, including binary and multi-class classification, as well as time series prediction. The QuEra team performed successful quantum machine leaning demonstration on up to 108 qubits, demonstrating the largest quantum machine learning experiment to date. We also observe comparative quantum kernel advantage in learning tasks by constructing synthetic datasets based on the geometric differences between generated quantum and classical data kernels. In this workshop we will cover the general methods utilized to run quantum reservoir computing in QuEra's neutral-atom analog hardware, providing an introduction for users to pursue new research directions.</em>
