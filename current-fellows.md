**Research Interests**: Jessie Micallef works on adapting and expanding machine learning solutions to apply to particle physics experiments. Her research focuses on neutrinos and studying neutrino oscillation, a unique phenomena that shows neutrinos deviate from their Standard Model prediction, with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. To improve oscillation measurements, Jessie created and optimized new convolution neural network (CNN) reconstructions for GeV-scale IceCube neutrinos. Jessie’s machine learning interests focus on adapting the forefront of ML solutions to noisy, sparse neutrino data; she hopes to explore topics of robustness, systematics aware learning, fast inference methods, and advanced neural networks to adapt to neutrino experiments.

**Biographical Sketch**: Jessie is a graduate student at Michigan State University (MSU) where she is pursuing a dual PhD in Physics and Computational Mathematics, Science, & Engineering. She is both a NSF Graduate Research Fellow and former ACM SIGHPC/Intel Computer Science Fellow. She did her undergrad at University of Michigan, where she worked on the particle physics experiment KOTO in Japan and tested neutrino detectors at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. In tandem with her research, Jessie also works to empower women and minorities in STEM by leading outreach and diversity initiatives through the Conferences for Undergraduate Women in Physics, MSU’s Women & Minorities in the Physical Sciences, and the IceCube collaboration. Outside of academia, Jessie enjoys creative writing, practicing longsword and jiu jitsu, and traveling to exciting places and events.
