He is particularly interested in physics- and symmetry-aware algorithms that are robust when trained on noisy or mis-modeled simulations. He hopes to apply this work towards building self-supervised foundation models for collider physics, which will greatly accelerate downstream classification and generative tasks. Sam’s doctoral work focused on dark matter searches and model-independent anomaly detection, and he looks forward to building deep learning-based reconstruction algorithms to power a new generation of low-mass dark photon searches.

<img src="images/small-photo-akshunna-dogra.jpg" align="right" style="max-width:300px;width:30%" hspace="20" vspace="20"/>

**Research Interests**: Akshunna's interests are rooted in mathematical and computational physics, with principled model design serving as his most used research vehicle, and Dynamical Systems, Fundamental Physics, and Machine Learning (ML) serving as the most visited topics. The versatility of their applications has allowed him to build models for problems in fluid dynamics, ML optimization, and quantum information. His generic approach to scientific model building is rooted in biasing the optimization dynamics towards optimal or near optimal solution models by leveraging known constraints and results on the problems and embedding them appropriately into the models. His doctoral work has been focused on providing unifying perspectives on the convergence regimes of ML models. He hopes to characterize the search phase of optimization as part of his fellowship and leverage such results for the creation of solution models for complex problems in QFT and String Theory.
