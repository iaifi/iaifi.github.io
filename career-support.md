## Finding jobs/internships

There are countless ways to identify potential jobs and internships. Some ways that IAIFI members and alumni have had success with include:
* Through their advisor
* [MIT Analytics Career Fair](https://www.analyticsfair.mit.edu/)
* Twitter
* Conference networking

## Application advice

* Mention researcher at the company who works on relevant topics to your research
* Include a short description of what you would like to work on in your application
* Know how to explain your work to a layperson knowledgeable in data science and machine learning; practice talking about research in compelling ways and make sure that this is reflected in your application materials
* Practice thinking about how you would implement an ML solution in business (e.g. a movie suggestion algorithm for Netflix)
* Consider how your implementation choices can affect different stakeholders and other parts of the business
* Have a well-organized repo with high-quality code samples
* Focus on doing cool/interesting research and building useful skills in your PhD
* Have someone from industry read over your application materials, they are very different from academia
* Reach out to people, in particular if you met them at conferences

## Interview advice

* Have a rough idea of the research youâ€™d like to work on
* Practice Leetcode questions and explaining your work
* Show that you can work well in a team in a fast-paced environment and can write good code and maintain a reasonably sized codebase
* Do a lot of interview prep until you feel confident doing any LeetCode problem while someone is watching (and judging); you also want to be able to do some basic stats and probability on the fly. 
* Be prepared to talk about your research in compelling ways
* Leetcode is good to prepare the coding aspects, but often times machine learning code interviews will be more conceptual and they'll just look for clean code (mention testing for instance and write tests if applicable, also read PEP 8) 
* Make sure that you can bring up an exciting project that they'll understand, the interviewer may just focus on that project and ask you questions about it

## Influence of experience on career goals

* Broadened ML knowledge, which will be useful in future career, and will be more open to work in industry in the future. 
* Made applying for academic jobs less stressful!
