## IAIFI Public Colloquia (Spring 2021)

In Spring 2021, our colloquium series will feature IAIFI senior investigators, aiming to introduce you to some of the exciting research being carried out at our institute.

All times are Boston time.  Please [sign up for our mailing list](http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/iaifi-news) to receive Zoom links for these events.


  * **Phiala Shanahan**
    * **Thursday, February 4, 11am-noon**
    * *"Ab-initio AI for first-principles calculations of the structure of matter"*
    * Abstract:  The unifying theme of IAIFI is “ab-initio AI”: novel approaches to AI that that draw from, and are motivated by, aspects of fundamental physics. In this context, I will discuss opportunities for machine learning, in particular generative models, to accelerate first-principles lattice quantum field theory calculations in particle and nuclear physics. Particular challenges in this context include incorporating complex (gauge) symmetries into model architectures, and scaling models to the large number of degrees of freedom of state-of-the-art numerical studies. I will show the results of proof-of-principle studies that demonstrate that sampling from generative models can be orders of magnitude more efficient than traditional Hamiltonian/hybrid Monte Carlo approaches in this context.
