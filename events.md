    * *"Understanding computation using physics and exploiting physics for computation"*
    * [YouTube Recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD7-OBMCaf0)
    * [Talk Slides](talks/2021_09_17_IAIFI_Colloquium_Ganguli.pdf)
    * Abstract: We are witnessing an exciting interplay between physics, computation and neurobiology that spans in multiple directions.  In one direction we can use the power of complex systems analysis, developed in theoretical physics and applied mathematics, to elucidate design principles governing how neural networks, both biological and artificial, learn and function. In another direction, we can exploit novel physics to instantiate new kinds of quantum neuromorphic computers using spins and photons. We will give several vignettes in both directions, including:  (1) determining the best optimization problem to solve in order to perform regression in high dimensions;  (2) deriving the detailed structure of the primate retina by analyzing optimal convolutional auto-encoders of natural movies; (3) describing and analyzing a quantum associative memory instantiated in a multimode cavity QED system; (4) understanding the geometry and dynamics of high dimensional optimization in the classical limit of a dissipative many-body quantum optimizer comprised of interacting photons.

    * *"Learning the Universe"*
    * [YouTube Recording](https://youtu.be/0UL6b5Sb9uo)
    * [Talk Slides](talks/2021_10_01_IAIFI_Colloquium_Wandelt.pdf)
    * Abstract: To realize the advances in cosmological knowledge we desire in the coming decade will require a new way for cosmological theory, simulation, and inference to interplay. As cosmologists we wish to learn about the origin, composition, evolution, and fate of the cosmos from all accessible sources of astronomical data, such as the cosmic microwave background, galaxy surveys, or electromagnetic and gravitational wave transients. Traditionally, the field has progressed by designing, modeling and measuring intuitive summaries of the data, such as 2-point correlations. This traditional approach has a number of risks and limitations: how do we know if we computed the most informative statistics? Did we omit any summaries that would have provided additional information or break parameter degeneracies? Are current approximations to the likelihood and physical modeling sufficient? I will discuss simulation-based, full-physics modeling approaches to cosmology that are powered by new ways of designing and running simulations of cosmological observables and of confronting models with data. Innovative machine-learning methods play an important role in making this possible. The goal is to use current and next-generation data to reconstruct the cosmological initial conditions; and constrain cosmological physics much more completely than has been feasible in the past. I will discuss the current status and challenges of this new approach.

    * *"Physics-Guided AI for Learning Spatiotemporal Dynamics"*
    * [YouTube Recording](https://youtu.be/B0VxQXMB53o)
    * [Talk Slides](talks/2021_10_15_IAIFI_Colloquium_Yu.pdf)
    * Abstract:  Applications such as public health, transportation, and climate science often require learning complex dynamics from large-scale spatiotemporal data. While deep learning has shown tremendous success in these domains, it remains a grand challenge to incorporate physical principles in a systematic manner to the design, training, and inference of such models. In this talk, we will demonstrate how to principally integrate physics in AI models and algorithms to achieve both prediction accuracy and physical consistency. We will showcase the application of these methods to problems such as forecasting COVID-19, traffic modeling, and accelerating turbulence simulations.

    * **Friday, October 29, 2:00-3:00pm** 
    * *"Theoretical Physicists’ Biases Meet Machine Learning"*
    * Abstract: Many recent successes in machine learning (ML) resemble the success story in theoretical particle physics of utilising symmetries as organising principle. I discuss an introductory example where this procedure applied in ML leads to new insights to PDEs in mathematical physics, more precisely for the study of Calabi-Yau metrics. Then I discuss methods on how to identify symmetries of a system without requiring knowledge about such symmetries, including also how to find a Lax pair/connection associated with integrable systems. If time permits, I discuss how latent representations in neural networks can offer a close resemblance of variables used in dual descriptions established analytically in physical systems.

    * **Friday, November 12, 2:00-3:00pm** 
    * *"Understanding deep learning"*
    * Abstract: Deep neural networks are a rich class of function approximators that are now ubiquitous in many domains and enable new frontiers in physics and other sciences, but their function, limitations, and governing principles are not yet well-understood. I will overview a few results from a research program seeking to understand deep learning by proceeding scientifically. These investigations draw ideas, tools, and inspiration from theoretical physics, with close guidance from computational experiments, and integrate together perspectives from computer science and statistics. I will discuss some past highlights from the study of overparameterized neural networks — such as exact connections to Gaussian processes and linear models, as well as information propagation in deep networks — and then focus on emerging questions surrounding the role of scale (so-called “scaling laws”) and predictability.

    * **Friday, December 10, 2:00-3:00pm** 
    * *"Machines to find ghost particles in big data"*
    * Abstract: The neutrino is the most mysterious of the standard model particles. They only interact weakly and can pass through light years of matter without leaving a trace. Since the discovery of neutrino oscillations, experiments provided the first positive evidence for physics beyond the standard model. Yet, there are remaining questions which answers may reveal new physics and possible explanation of the asymmetry in the presence of matters and anti-matters in the current universe.  A new generation of neutrino experiments are coming online to address those questions in the era of high precision measurements. The detector is becoming larger and denser to gain high statistics of measurements, and detector technologies evolve toward particle imaging, essentially a hi-resolution "camera", in order to capture every single detail of particles produced in a neutrino interaction. The forefront of such detector technologies is a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC), which is capable of recording images of charged particle tracks with breathtaking resolution.  Such detailed information will allow LArTPCs to perform accurate particle identification and calorimetry, making it the detector of choice for many current and future neutrino experiments.  However, analyzing hi-resolution imaging data can be challenging, requiring the development of many algorithms to identify and assemble features of the events in order to reconstruct neutrino interactions.  In the recent years, we have developed new approach using deep neural networks (DNNs), a modern solution to a pattern recognition for image-like data in the field of Computer Vision. A modern DNNs can be applied for various types of problems such as data reconstruction tasks including interaction vertex identification, pixel clustering, particle type and flow reconstruction. In this talk I will discuss the challenges of data reconstruction for imaging detectors, recent work and future plans for deploying a full machine learning based data reconstruction chain for LArTPC experiments.

    * *"Learning metrics in extra dimensions"*
    * Abstract: String theory is a very promising candidate for a fundamental theory of our universe. An interesting prediction of string theory is that spacetime is ten-dimensional. Since we only observe four spacetime dimensions, the extra six dimensions are small and compact, thus evading detection. These extra six-dimensional spaces, known as Calabi-Yau spaces, are very special and elusive. They are equipped with a special metric needed to make string theory consistent. This special property is given in terms of a (notoriously hard) type of partial differential equation. While we know, thanks to the heroic work of Calabi and Yau, that this PDE has a unique solution and hence that the metric exists, we neither know what it looks like nor how to construct it explicitly. However, the metric is an important quantity that enters in many physical observables, e.g. particle masses. Thinking of the metric as a function that satisfies three constraints that enter in the Calabi-Yau theorem, we can parameterize the metric as a neural network and formulate the problem as multiple continuous optimization tasks. The neural network is trained (akin to self-supervision) by sampling points from the Calabi-Yau space and imposing the constraints entering the theorem as customized loss functions.

    * *"Machine Learning for Quantum Many-body Physics"*
    * Abstract: The study of quantum many-body physics plays an crucial role across condensed matter physics, high energy physics and quantum information science. Due to the exponential growing nature of Hilbert space, challenges arise for exact classical simulations of high dimensional wave function which is the core object in quantum many-body physics. A natural question comes as whether machine learning, which is powerful for processing high dimensional probability distribution, can provide new methods for studying quantum many-body physics. In contrast to the standard high dimensional probability distribution, the wave function further exhibits complex phase structure and rich symmetries besides high dimensionality. It opens up a series of interesting questions for high dimensional optimization, sampling and representation imposed by quantum many-body physics. In this talk, I will discuss recent advancement of the field and present (1) neural network representations for quantum states with Fermionic anti-symmetry and gauge symmetries; (2) neural network simulations for ground state and real time dynamics in condensed matter physics, high energy physics and quantum information science; (3) quantum control protocol discovery with machine learning.

    * *"Inductive bias of neural networks"*
    * Abstract: A learner’s performance depends crucially on how its internal assumptions, or inductive biases, align with the task at hand. I will present a theory that describes the inductive biases of neural networks in the infinite width limit using kernel methods and statistical mechanics. This theory elucidates an inductive bias to explain data with "simple functions" which are identified by solving a related kernel eigenfunction problem on the data distribution. This notion of simplicity allows us to characterize whether a network is compatible with a learning task, facilitating good generalization performance from a small number of training examples. I will present applications of the theory to deep networks (at finite width) trained on synthetic and real datasets, and recordings from the mouse primary visual cortex. Finally, I will briefly present an extension of the theory to out-of-distribution generalization.

    * *"Lessons from the Dark Machines Anomaly Score Challenge"*
    * Abstract: With LHC experiments producing strong exclusion bounds on theoretical new physics models, there has been recent interest in model agnostic methods to search for physics beyond the standard model. The Dark Machines group conducted a "challenge" as an open playground to examine unsupervised anomaly detection methods on simulated collider events. In this discussion, I briefly motivate and introduce anomaly detection, along with the public data set. We found that the methods which performed best across a wide range of signals shared a common feature; the metric for determining how anomalous an event is depends only on how the event can be encoded into a small representation - there is no decoding step. The discussion will start with speculations about why the "fixed target" encoding can work and look to future tests.
