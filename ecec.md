## Early Career and Ethics Committee

The Early Career & Ethics Committee (ECEC) serves as an advisory body to IAIFI Management on aspects related to early career researchers, as well as to oversee the well-being and working environment of all IAIFI members. Their goal is to create a welcoming, and enjoyable place of work, where people of all backgrounds and career stages can feel supported to do their best work and advance forward in their careers in an environment free from discrimination and injustice.

## Mentorship Resources
An important element of supporting early career researchers is mentorship. There are a number of resources available online and through IAIFI universities to help students and postdocs make the most of their mentorship relationships. Most of these resources are openly available regardless of which university you are affiliated with. 

### General Resources
* [The Center for the Improvement of Mentored Experiences in Research (CIMER)](https://cimerproject.org/) provides [curricula](https://cimerproject.org/curricula-overview/) and [mentor/mentee support resources](https://cimerproject.org/mentor-mentee-support-resources/)

### MIT
* [Postdoctoral Mentoring and Advising Toolkit](https://postdocs.mit.edu/mentoring-and-advising/postdoctoral-mentoring-and-advising-toolkit) for both mentors and mentees
* [Research Mentoring Certificate](https://capd.mit.edu/pd-certificates/) provides an opportunity for grad students and postdocs to develop their mentoring skills (for MIT community only)

### Harvard
* [Office of Undergraduate Research and Fellowships Advice for Mentor Relationships](https://uraf.harvard.edu/work-with-faculty/getting-started) offers guidance on identifying mentors and establishing and maintaining the relationship

### Northeastern 
* [Mentor and Mentee Toolkit](https://faculty.northeastern.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/04/Mentoring-Panel-Toolkit-FINAL.pdf) provides guidance on making the most of mentoring relationships

## Ethics

The IAIFI appreciates that the responsible and ethical conduct of research is critical, not only for scientific excellence, but also to maintain the public's trust in science. This goes beyond generating and disseminating knowledge with rigor and integrity; it also includes protecting intellectual property from inappropriate disclosure and treating everyone involved in the scientific process fairly and with respect.

### Responsible Conduct of Research
All IAIFI Junior Investigators are required to complete an online training course in the responsible conduct of research (RCR).

### Ethics-related IAIFI talks
Each semester we hold at least one ethics-related IAIFI talk (colloquium, seminar, or journal club). Past events include:
* April 22, 2021: IAIFI Seminar with [David Kaiser](https://web.mit.edu/dikaiser/www/) (MIT), "Social and Ethical Responsibilities of Computing (SERC): New Activities at MIT";
*  December 3, 2021: IAIFI Seminar with [Harini Suresh](https://harinisuresh.com) (MIT), "Understanding Sources of Harm through the Machine Learning Life Cycle".
* May 5, 2022: IAIFI Journal Club with [Dylan Hadfield](https://people.csail.mit.edu/dhm/) (MIT), "Overoptimization, Incompleteness, and Goodhartâ€™s Law"
* November 29, 2022: IAIFI Journal Club with [Anna Golubeva](https://annagolubeva.github.io) (IAIFI Fellow) and [Matt Schwartz](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/schwartz) (Harvard), "Should artificial intelligence be interpretable to humans?"
* December 16, 2022: IAIFI seminar with [Aleksander Madry](https://madry.mit.edu) (MIT), "What (and how) the ML models learn";
