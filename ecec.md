## Early Career and Ethics Committee

The Early Career & Ethics Committee (ECEC) serves as an advisory body to IAIFI Management on aspects related to early career researchers, as well as to oversee the well-being and working environment of all IAIFI members. Their goal is to create a welcoming, and enjoyable place of work, where people of all backgrounds and career stages can feel supported to do their best work and advance forward in their careers in an environment free from discrimination and injustice.

## Ethics

The IAIFI appreciates that the responsible and ethical conduct of research is critical, not only for scientific excellence, but also to maintain the public's trust in science. This goes beyond generating and disseminating knowledge with rigor and integrity; it also includes protecting intellectual property from inappropriate disclosure and treating everyone involved in the scientific process fairly and with respect.

### Responsible Conduct of Research
All IAIFI Junior Investigators are required to complete an online training course in the responsible conduct of research (RCR).

### Ethics-related IAIFI talks
Each semester we hold at least one ethics-related IAIFI talk (colloquium, seminar, or journal club). Past events include:
* April 22, 2021: IAIFI Seminar with [David Kaiser](https://web.mit.edu/dikaiser/www/) (MIT), "Social and Ethical Responsibilities of Computing (SERC): New Activities at MIT";
