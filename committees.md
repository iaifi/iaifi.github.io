IAIFI is establishing forums and committees that include a mix of faculty, postdocs, and students to plan and coordinate primary IAIFI activities. Current IAIFI Forums and Committees and their details are listed below. If you are interested in joining any of the groups below, [email iaifi@mit.edu](mailto:iaifi@mit.edu).

# Forums
The Forums entail monthly standing meetings, organized around IAIFI's three pillars of Research, Talent, and Community. IAIFI members can volunteer to be on the board of a forum; the forums are also open to any and all IAIFI members to attend. 

## Research
* The IAIFI Research Forum is responsible for the IAIFI strategic pillar: Pioneering interdisciplinary AI+Physics research. This includes identifying ways to share IAIFI research across IAIFI, facilitating interdisciplinary collaborations, and optimizing research reporting and communication.
* At-a-glance: Takes point on IAIFI's Thematic Discussion Sessions, mini-workshops, and research reporting/communication 
* Board Members (Fall 2025): Matt Schwartz, Harvard (Chair); Sam Bright-Thonney, IAIFI Fellow; Berthy Feng, IAIFI Fellow; Alex Gagliano, IAIFI Fellow; Gaia Grosso, IAIFI Fellow; Marisa LaFleur, IAIFI Managing Director; Thomas Bradford, IAIFI Project Coordinator

## Talent
* The IAIFI Talent Forum is responsible for the IAIFI strategic pillar: Empowering the next generation of AI+Physics talent. This includes identifying ways to provide career support for IAIFI early career researchers, ensuring the well-being and thoughtful inclusion of researchers of all career stages in IAIFI, and monitoring other issues of particular interest to IAIFI early career researchers, such as computing resources and mentoring.
* At-a-glance: Takes point on mentorship, career support, early career perspectives, and computing resources
* Board Members (Fall 2025): Edo Berger, Harvard (Co-Chair); Marin Soljacic, MIT (Co-Chair); Sachin Vaidya, MIT; Andrzej Novak, MIT; Zhuo Chen, MIT; Marisa LaFleur, IAIFI Managing Director; Thomas Bradford, IAIFI Project Coordinator

## Community
* The IAIFI Community Forum is responsible for the IAIFI strategic pillar: Building a dynamic AI+Physics Community. This includes building up the internal IAIFI community to break down barriers across domains and universities, and the broader national/international AI+Physics community to bring together key researchers (industry and academia) in AI+Physics and educate the public about AI+Science broadly. Through this work, we aim to establish IAIFI as a hub for AI+Physics in the Boston area and beyond, and help advocate for AI+Science. 
* At-a-glance: Takes point on social events, public engagement (including K-12), and industry partnerships
* Board Members (Fall 2025): Fabian Ruehle, Northeastern (Chair); Thomas Harvey, IAIFI Fellow; Christian Ferko, Northeastern; Steven Eulig, Harvard; Joydeep Naskar, Northeastern; Juvenal Bassa, UPRM; Jamie Sullivan, MIT; Marisa LaFleur, IAIFI Managing Director; Thomas Bradford, IAIFI Project Coordinator
