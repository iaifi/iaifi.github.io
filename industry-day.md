**IAIFI is pleased to host our first "IAIFI Industry Day" on Friday, August 14, 2026 at MIT.** 

The goal of this event is to foster collaboration, awareness, and networking between IAIFI industry partners and IAIFI researchers working at the intersection of AI and Physics.

*The event will be co-located with the IAIFI Summer Workshop, which will also allow both IAIFI and partners to share their work more broadly with interested attendees.*
