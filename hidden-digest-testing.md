Is the ground state of Anderson’s impurity model a recurrent neural network?
When the Anderson impurity model (AIM) is expressed in terms of a Wilson chain it assumes a hierarchical Renormalization group structure that translates to a ground state with features like Friedel oscillations and the Kondo screening cloud [1]. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have recently gained traction in the form of Neural Quantum States (NQS) ansätze for quantum many body ground states and they are known to be able to learn such complex patterns [2]. We explore RNNs as an ansatz to capture the AIM’s ground state for a given Wilson chain length and investigate its capability to predict the ground state on longer chains for a converged ground state energy.

Efthymios Tziniz, Research Scientist, Google
Efthymios (Thymios) is a research scientist working on uni- and multi-modal sound separation and sound understanding in general. His research interests include the development of self-supervised audio and video perception machine learning models and their efficient deployment on low-energy mobile devices. He got his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and also holds a diploma (B.Sc. + M.Eng.) in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the National Technical University of Athens. He has co-authored more than 30 papers in the field of audio and audio-visual processing and holds two US patents. He has also been a past recipient of the Google Ph.D. fellowship for Machine Perception, Speech Technology and Computer Vision.

Is flow-matching an alternative to diffusion?
We discuss flow-matching (2210.02747), a recently proposed objective for training continuous normalizing flows inspired by diffusion models. As a generative model, flow-matching can produce state-of-the-art samples for images and other data representations. More interestingly, flow-matching can be used to go beyond generative modeling by learning to approximate the optimal transport map between two arbitrary data distributions. The JC is meant to be an interactive blackboard talk discussing the method. At the end, I’ll flash a few slides illustrating its usefulness for generating jets as particle clouds (2310.00049).

IAIFI Discussion Seminar
Friday, February 23, 2024, 2:00pm–3:00pm
Michael Albergo, Postdoctoral Fellow, Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences
Dynamical Measure Transport: Theory and Applications
I will discuss recent advances in generative modeling from the perspective of transport between probability densities. In particular, I will describe efforts to unify flow-based and diffusion based generative modeling methods through a paradigm known as stochastic interpolants. Using these ideas, I will illustrate various ways to make generative models more performant for conventional tasks, such as image generation, while also highlighting new applications in domains such as scientific computing, for example in the probabilistic forecasting of dynamical systems.
