title: Foundational AI Research
---

As discussed above, *ab initio* AI promises to greatly improve theoretical and experimental physics in ways that we are only beginning to explore. In turn, the unique features of these physics applications offer compelling research opportunities in AI more broadly. For example, physical systems often feature exact or approximate symmetries. Exploiting these known invariances in data structures and algorithms is a key to developing efficient algorithms for physics applications, but is also likely to be transformative in broader contexts. Physics-informed architectures and hardware development promise advances in the speed of AI algorithms, and work in statistical physics is providing a theoretical foundation for understanding AI dynamics. The IAIFI is supporting these efforts that deeply entwine our *ab initio* AI research with our *ab inito* physics goals.
