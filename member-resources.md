## Understand Levels of Involvement

Unless otherwise noted, the opportunities listed on this page are available to members at all levels of involvement in IAIFI.  


Unless otherwise noted, these opportunities are available to all IAIFI members, including those who report their IAIFI-related activities to the NSF (Senior Investigators, Junior Investigator, and IAIFI Affiliate) and those who do not (Friends of IAIFI).


There are various levels at which you can be involved in IAIFI.  

**Senior Investigators, Junior Investigators, IAIFI Affiliates**:  Members in these categories must report their IAIFI-related activities to the NSF.
{:.info}

**Friend of IAIFI**:  Friends of IAIFI cannot receive NSF funding and have no reporting requirements, but are welcome to participate in internal IAIFI activities.
{:.info}

Unless otherwise noted, the opportunities listed on this page are available to members at *all* levels of involvement in IAIFI.

## Get Involved Beyond IAIFI

We encourage IAIFI members to be involved in programs and initiatives not affiliated with IAIFI, but which can provide new insights and value to the IAIFI community, including sharing relevant events and best practices.  If you have other suggestions for ways the IAIFI community can be involved beyond IAIFI, [email IAIFI Management](mailto:iaifi@mit.edu).
