## Understand Levels of Involvement

Unless otherwise noted, the opportunities listed on this page are available to members at all levels of involvement in IAIFI.  


Unless otherwise noted, these opportunities are available to all IAIFI members, including those who report their IAIFI-related activities to the NSF (Senior Investigators, Junior Investigator, and IAIFI Affiliate) and those who do not (Friends of IAIFI).


There are various levels at which you can be involved in IAIFI.  

**Senior Investigators, Junior Investigators, IAIFI Affiliates**:  Members in these categories must report their IAIFI-related activities to the NSF.
{:.info}

**Friend of IAIFI**:  Friends of IAIFI cannot receive NSF funding and have no reporting requirements, but are welcome to participate in internal IAIFI activities.
{:.info}

Unless otherwise noted, the opportunities listed on this page are available to members at *all* levels of involvement in IAIFI.

## Advertise and acknowledge IAIFI
  * **Acknowledgement:** Include IAIFI acknowledgment, **including IAIFI's grant number,** in IAIFI-related papers. This is required if you are a Junior or Senior Investigator, **especially if you are using IAIFI computing resources**.
    * Example acknowledgement language: "This work is supported by the National Science Foundation under Cooperative Agreement PHY-2019786 (The NSF AI Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions, http://iaifi.org/)."
  * **Affiliation:** Include IAIFI affiliation in papers: The NSF AI Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions (Note: There is no address.)
  * **If using compute or other resources, regardless of role:** Anyone who benefits from IAIFI activities, etc, is welcome to use the above acknowledgment wording if you think it’s appropriate. Alternatively, if you aren't directly funded, you could choose to use something like this: This work [benefited from/was inspired by/was initiated as a result of] interactions with the NSF AI Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions, http://iaifi.org/, which is supported by the National Science Foundation under Cooperative Agreement PHY-2019786.
  * **IAIFI Logo:** Use the IAIFI (with NSF) logo in talks related to IAIFI: [Black](images/iaifi-nsf-logo-black.pdf);  [White](images/iaifi-nsf-logo-white.pdf);
      [Rainbow](images/iaifi-logo-square-rainbow.pdf)
  * **Standard IAIFI Slides:** Share slides advertising public IAIFI opportunities when appropriate: [Overview Slide](images/iaifi-oneslide-overview.pdf); [Resources and Activities Slide](images/iaifi-oneslide-resources.pdf)
  * **News:** When you're in the news, [email IAIFI Management](mailto:iaifi@mit.edu) so that we can share on the [home page](index.html) (news on the home page is eventually moved to the [News Archive](iaifi-news.html)), [tweet about it](https://twitter.com/iaifi_news), and include in reports
  
<!--
* Get Involved Beyond IAIFI: We encourage IAIFI members to be involved in programs and initiatives not affiliated with IAIFI, but which can provide new insights and value to the IAIFI community, including sharing relevant events and best practices.  If you have other suggestions for ways the IAIFI community can be involved beyond IAIFI, [email IAIFI Management](mailto:iaifi@mit.edu).
* <img class="image" src="images/zulip-icon-128x128.png" align="right" style="max-width:128px;width:10%" hspace="10" vspace="10"/> IAIFI utilizes [Zulip](https://zulip.com) for informal communication among members. Zulip is an open-source modern team chat app designed to keep both live and asynchronous conversations organized. [Follow these instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RjddJR6ER4mlXq438C5RkAIv-ZisUPwibTm52-2o_Yw/edit?usp=sharing) to sign up for the IAIFI Zulip if you are an IAIFI member.
