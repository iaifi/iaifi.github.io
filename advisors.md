# External Advisory Board

IAIFI's External Advisory Board (EAB) provides project oversight and advice to help ensure that the goals and objectives of the IAIFI are met and also offers guidance toward realizing and honing its vision. The EAB represents a balance of representation in categories contributing to IAIFI’s strategic goals. The EAB includes experts in AI (both industry and academia), Physics Experiment, Physics Theory, and Astrophysics. It also includes experts with experience in Education and Workforce Development, Outreach, institute management, and industry.

### Brian Nord
**Research Scientist, Fermilab**

[Brian Nord](http://briandnord.com)'s work focuses on how to improve the ways in which we make scientific discoveries --- developing algorithms, designing experiments, and re-envisioning research communities. Brian started his career in large-scale structure simulations. Since then, he has studied galaxy clusters, strong gravitational lensing, and the cosmic microwave background. More recently, he has explored the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to address critical challenges in cosmological data analysis. Currently, he is integrating AI with rigorous statistical methods and using this to aid in the precise design of scientific experiments. As a researcher in the Fermilab AI Project Office and Cosmic Physics Center, he provides strategic vision to the lab with respect to AI research investments. He has a joint appointment at the University Chicago, where he also conducts his AI research. Brian is a leader in the movement to address inequities and oppression in academic and research environments. He co-created the academic #Strike4BlackLives (strike4blacklives.com) in June 2020 and works to drive anti-racist efforts and develop justice-oriented communities. He co-founded the Deep Skies Community (deepskieslab.ai), which is dedicated to shared leadership and prioritizing the humanity of research colleagues over productivity --- one of the first of its kind. He is a co-author of ThisIsBlackLight.com, a curriculum for learning about Black experiences. He also co-founded the Change Now team, which produced a list of calls for action to make a more just laboratory environment at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory.
