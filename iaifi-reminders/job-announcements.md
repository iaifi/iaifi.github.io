## IAIFI-Adjacent Job Opportunities
We are pleased to share several academic job openings at IAIFI-affiliated universities below. Researchers in these positions would have the opportunity to join and/or collaborate with IAIFI. 

### MIT Assistant Professor, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Physics 

The Department of Physics together with the Schwarzman College of Computing (SCC) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) located in Cambridge, MA, invites applications for a faculty position at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Physics at the level of tenure-track Assistant Professor beginning July 1, 2026 or as soon thereafter as possible. We encourage candidates doing relevant research on any aspect of AI and Physics, broadly defined, including using Physics principles and methodologies to understand and develop AI models and algorithms, and using AI to help solve problems in Physics. We particularly welcome candidates who would strengthen connections between AI, Physics, Computer Science, Mathematics, and/or Statistics.

Applications submitted online to AcademicJobsOnline.org by December 1, 2025 will receive full consideration.

### MIT Schwarzman College of Computing Tayebati Postdoctoral Fellow

The new Tayebati Postdoctoral Fellowship Program at MIT, sponsored by the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing, focuses on AI for addressing the most challenging problems in select scientific research areas, and AI for music composition and performance. The program concentrates on work that brings cutting-edge AI to bear on research in science or music, to advance both the research area and the development of relevant AI methods. Candidates will be working on projects at the forefront of one of the six disciplinary areas: Biology/Bioengineering; Brain and Cognitive Sciences; Chemistry/Chemical Engineering; Materials Science and Engineering; Music; or Physics.

To receive full consideration, all application materials (including letters of recommendation) must be submitted by December 1, 2025.

### Northeastern Postdoc, Simons Collaboration on the Physics of Learning

Northeastern University in Boston has a Fall 2026 opening for a Postdoctoral Research Associate to work with the recently established Simons Collaboration on the Physics of Learning (physicsoflearning.org). The Simons Collaboration is harnessing the fundamental sciences to break AI out of its black box using techniques from mathematics and theoretical physics. The successful candidate is expected to contribute to the scientific mission of the collaboration, bringing their technical expertise to bear on problems in AI. Proposals for new scientific directions are welcomed, and the researcher will have an opportunity to collaborate with anyone in the Collaboration. The successful candidate will also have the opportunity to interact and collaborate with the NSF AI Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions (IAIFI).

The deadline to apply is December 15, 2025.
