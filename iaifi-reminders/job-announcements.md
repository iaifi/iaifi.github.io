## IAIFI-Adjacent Job Opportunities
We are pleased to share several academic job openings at IAIFI-affiliated universities below. Researchers in these positions would have the opportunity to join and/or collaborate with IAIFI. 

### MIT Assistant Professor, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Physics 

The Department of Physics together with the Schwarzman College of Computing (SCC) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) located in Cambridge, MA, invites applications for a faculty position at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Physics at the level of tenure-track Assistant Professor beginning July 1, 2026 or as soon thereafter as possible. We encourage candidates doing relevant research on any aspect of AI and Physics, broadly defined, including using Physics principles and methodologies to understand and develop AI models and algorithms, and using AI to help solve problems in Physics. We particularly welcome candidates who would strengthen connections between AI, Physics, Computer Science, Mathematics, and/or Statistics.

Applications submitted online to AcademicJobsOnline.org by December 1, 2025 will receive full consideration.
