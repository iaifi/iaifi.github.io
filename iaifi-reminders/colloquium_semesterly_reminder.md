## Announcing IAIFI Fall 2025 Pubic Colloquium Series

We are pleased to announce the lineup for our Fall 2025 IAIFI Colloquium series, featuring researchers at the intersection of Physics and AI from a variety of sectors. 

Each colloquium will be broadcast over Zoom (details below), and live on [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCueoFcGm_15kSB-wDd4CBZA), where you can view recordings of past colloquia as well. We will send additional details about each colloquium as it approaches, and you can view updates on [the IAIFI Public Events page](https://iaifi.org/events.html).

If you are local to the Boston area and would like to attend IAIFI events in person, please [complete the interest form](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/3cff913c564141249c4292ad8c435774) to be added as a Friend of IAIFI.

We hope you can join us for this round of IAIFI colloquia!

* **September 12: [Francisco Villaescusa-Navarro](https://franciscovillaescusa.github.io/) (Research Scientist, Simons Foundation)**
    * *The Denario project: Deep knowledge AI agents for scientific discovery*
    * Artificial intelligence is rapidly changing the way we perform scientific research. In this talk, I will illustrate how AI agents can assist in a wide range of scientific tasks — from hypothesis generation and data exploration to code development and paper writing. I will present a variety of agents that we have designed for different purposes, including the CAMELS agents, CMBAgent, and CLAPP, highlighting how each of them tackles different challenges. To illustrate the potential of AI agents, I will try to write several scientific papers live, covering different areas of research and showcasing the versatility of these tools. Next, I will show some of the papers generated by Denario (our in-house AI research assistant), covering many research areas such as astrophysics, biology, biophysics, chemistry, medicine, planetary physics, mathematical physics, and neuroscience. Beyond the technical aspects, I will also discuss the broader implications: what these advances mean for the practice of science, how they may reshape the workflow of researchers, and the new skills we may need to foster in the next generation of scientists. Finally, I will invite an open discussion about both the opportunities and risks of deploying AI agents in scientific contexts, with the goal of reflecting collectively on how these technologies might transform the future of research.
