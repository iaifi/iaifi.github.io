### Today's Schedule

**9:00–9:30 am ET**

Welcome/Introduction

**9:30 am–12:00 pm ET**

Lecture 1: Elements of Interactive Decision Making (Sasha Rakhlin, MIT)

*Machine learning methods are increasingly deployed in interactive
environments, ranging from dynamic treatment strategies in medicine to
fine-tuning of LLMs using reinforcement learning. In these settings,
the learning agent interacts with the environment to collect data and
necessarily faces an exploration-exploitation dilemma.\\
\\
In this lecture, we’ll begin with multi-armed bandits, progressing
through structured and contextual bandits. We’ll then move on to
reinforcement learning and broader decision-making frameworks,
outlining the key algorithmic approaches and statistical principles
that underpin each setting. Our goal is to develop both a rigorous
understanding of the learning guarantees and a toolbox of fundamental
algorithms.*
