## IAIFI Summer School Day 4
Welcome to the fourth day of the IAIFI Summer School 2025! Follow along with today's schedule below.

The lecture and tutorial will be held in room LL2.224 and on the same Zoom link for those attending virtually. The sessions will also be recorded and the recordings will be shared at the end of the day. 

The breakout sessions at 3:30pm will be held in room 2.122 (with SueYeon Chung and Sam Bright-Thonney), and in room 3.301 (with Aleksandra Ciprajanovic and Sneh Pandya). The same Zoom link will be also used for the breakout sessions (using Zoom's breakout rooms feature).

### Important Reminders
* Tutorial materials can be found on the [IAIFI Summer School GitHub](https://github.com/iaifi/summer-school-2025).
* If you are staying in the dorms and you misplace your keys or lock yourself out of your room, please do your best to call the residence life number during business hours, as it will be much more straightforward to resolve the issue.

### Today's Schedule

**9:00–9:30 am ET**

Lightning Talks

**9:30 am–12:00 pm ET**

Lecture 4: Domain Shift Problem: Building Robust AI Models with Domain Adaptation (Aleksandra Ciprajanovic, Fermilab)

*Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing physics research—from probing the large-scale structure of the Universe to modeling subatomic interactions and fundamental forces. Yet, a major challenge persists: AI models trained on simulations or old experiment / astronomical survey often perform poorly when applied to new data—exposing issues of dataset (domain) shift, model robustness, and uncertainty in predictions. This summer school session will introduce students to common challenges in applying AI across domains and present solutions based on domain adaptation—a set of techniques designed to improve model generalization under domain shift. We will cover foundational ideas, practical strategies, and current research frontiers in this area. Through examples in astrophysics, we'll explore how domain adaptation can help bridge the gap between synthetic and real-world data, improve trust in model outputs, and advance scientific discovery. The concepts discussed are broadly applicable across physics and other scientific disciplines, making this a valuable topic for anyone interested in building robust, transferable AI models for science.*
