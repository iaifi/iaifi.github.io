## IAIFI Summer School Day 2
Welcome to the second day of the IAIFI Summer School 2025! Follow along with today's schedule below.

The lecture and tutorial will be held in room LL2.224 and on the same Zoom link for those attending virtually. The sessions will also be recorded and the recordings will be shared at the end of the day. 

The breakout sessions at 3:30pm will be held in room 2.122 (with Sasha Rakhlin and Margalit Glasgow), and in room 3.301 (with Gaia Grosso, Sean Benevedes, and Jigyasa Nigam). Zoom links will be available for virtual attendees as well.

Lecture 2: Physics-Guided Optimizations: Inform and Inspire AI Models with Physics Principles (Gaia Grosso, IAIFI Fellow)

*This lecture presents key concepts and techniques for designing machine learning models both informed by and inspired by physics principles. In the first part, we explore ways to inform AI models about physics constraints and data properties. We examine the highly structured nature of data in the physical sciences—such as images, point clouds, and time series—and discuss how their geometric and physical properties shape effective machine learning approaches. We then cover practical strategies for incorporating physical constraints through loss functions, regularization, and inductive biases. In the second part, we highlight how physical principles can inspire the design of optimization methods and AI architectures, introducing concepts like annealing, diffusion, entropy, and energy-based models, and showing examples of their growing role in modern machine learning.*
