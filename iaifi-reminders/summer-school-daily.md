## IAIFI Summer School Day 3
Welcome to the third day of the IAIFI Summer School 2025! Follow along with today's schedule below.

The lecture and tutorial will be held in room LL2.224 and on the same Zoom link for those attending virtually. The sessions will also be recorded and the recordings will be shared at the end of the day. 

This evening, we are hosting the Summer School Social, sponsored by [PDT Partners](https://pdtpartners.com/). The event will start with a presentation by [Boris Hanin](https://boris-hanin.github.io/) (Princeton) from 5:30-6:30pm, followed by a catered reception from 6:30-8:00pm.

**The Social will be held at the Harvard University Physics building (17 Oxford St, Cambridge)**. Boris Hanin’s presentation will be in room J250, and the social afterwards will be at the Library on the fourth floor. There are a few options to get from the SEC to 17 Oxford St: 
  * Walk about 30 minutes
  * Take the Harvard Shuttle at 5:00 pm
  * Take the 86 or 66 bus (will take about 25 minutes total)

Lecture 3: Computing with Neural Manifolds: 
A Multi-Scale Framework for Understanding Biological and Artificial Neural Networks (SueYeon Chung, Harvard)

*Recent breakthroughs in experimental neuroscience and machine learning have opened new frontiers in understanding the computational principles governing neural circuits and artificial neural networks (ANNs). Both biological and artificial systems exhibit an astonishing degree of orchestrated information processing capabilities across multiple scales - from the microscopic responses of individual neurons to the emergent macroscopic phenomena of cognition and task functions. At the mesoscopic scale, the structures of neuron population activities manifest themselves as neural representations. Neural computation can be viewed as a series of transformations of these representations through various processing stages of the brain. The primary focus of my lab's research is to develop theories of neural representations that describe the principles of neural coding and, importantly, capture the complex structure of real data from both biological and artificial systems.\\
\\
In this lecture, I will present three related approaches that leverage techniques from statistical physics, machine learning, and geometry to study the multi-scale nature of neural computation. First, I will introduce new statistical mechanical theories that connect geometric structures that arise from neural responses (i.e., neural manifolds) to the efficiency of neural representations in implementing a task. Second, I will employ these theories to analyze how these representations evolve across scales, shaped by the properties of single neurons and the transformations across distinct brain regions. Finally, I will show how these insights extend efficient coding principles beyond early sensory stages, linking representational geometry to efficient task implementations. This framework not only help interpret and compare models of brain data but also offers a principled approach to designing ANN models for higher-level vision. This perspective opens new opportunities for using neuroscience-inspired principles to guide the development of intelligent systems.*
