### IAIFI Research Panel on the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics
**March 14, 2025**

The 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics recognized John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton for their development of foundational and physics-inspired machine learning frameworks (the Hopfield network and the Boltzmann machine, respectively). Following IAIFI's' fireside chat discussing the historical significance of the award in Fall 2024, IAIFI hosted a panel discussion that dove deeper into the impact of Hopfield and Hinton’s work, and more broadly of physics insights, on interdisciplinary research tackling the understanding of artificial and biological intelligent systems. The panelists included [Cengiz Pehlevan](https://pehlevan.seas.harvard.edu/people/cengiz-pehlevan) (Kempner Institute/Harvard University), [Dmitry Krotov](https://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu/people/dmitry-krotov/) (MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab/IBM Research), and [Ila Fiete](https://mcgovern.mit.edu/profile/ila-fiete/) (McGovern Institute/MIT).
