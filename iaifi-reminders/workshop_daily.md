## Welcome to the 2025 IAIFI Summer Workshop!

The Summer Workshop begins today at 9 am at Harvard's Northwest Building (52 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138), in the lower atrium (head down the stairs/elevator when you enter the building). The plenary talks will be held in room B103.

The Workshop will begin promptly at 9:00 am on Monday, August 11, so please arrive between 8:15 and 8:45 am to check in (coffee will be available). We will not have printed programs, but you can view the full agenda here: [https://iaifi.org/summer-workshop.html#agenda](https://iaifi.org/summer-workshop.html#agenda).
