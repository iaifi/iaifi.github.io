## Other Upcoming Events

We are also pleased to announce the **4th Annual AI4EIC Workshop – Artificial Intelligence for the Electron-Ion Collider**, taking place from October 27–29, 2025, in a hybrid format, with in-person sessions hosted at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, MA. As in previous years, the workshop is organized with the support of the AI4EIC Working Group of the EIC User Group (EICUG) and a multi-institutional scientific organizing committee. This year, the Workshop is co-sponsored by the NSF Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions (IAIFI), including organization and funding support. 

Building on the productive exchanges of [previous AI4EIC events](https://eic.ai), this year's workshop will explore both current and emerging applications of AI/ML within the EIC, including work related to the ePIC experiment and beyond. The program will feature contributions from experts across academia, national laboratories, and industry. We are also excited to announce a dedicated workfest on AI Retrieval Agents for EIC Science, organized by AI4EIC, offering a hands-on opportunity for collaborative development and discussion during the Workshop. 

Registration is now open, and abstract submissions are welcome.
