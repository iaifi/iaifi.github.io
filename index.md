<h2>The NSF AI Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions (IAIFI)</h2>
</div>
</center>

The NSF AI Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions [(IAIFI, pronounced /aɪ-faɪ/)](/about.html) is one of the inaugural NSF AI research institutes. The IAIFI is advancing physics knowledge -- from the smallest building blocks of nature to the largest structures in the Universe -- and galvanizing AI research innovation. The IAIFI is a collaboration of both [physics and AI researchers](/people.html) at MIT, Harvard, Northeastern, and Tufts.  Learn more about our [research](/research.html) at the Physics/AI intersection and about our [IAIFI Fellows](/fellows.html) program.

### IAIFI Jobs

***Applications for the 2022-2025 IAIFI Fellowship are now closed.*** Updates on future competitions will be provided on the [IAIFI Fellows page](https://iaifi.org/fellows). You can also [Sign up for our mailing list](http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/iaifi-news) to receive announcements for future competitions.
