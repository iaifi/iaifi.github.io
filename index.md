<h2>The NSF AI Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions (IAIFI)</h2>
</div>
</center>

The NSF AI Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions [(IAIFI, pronounced /aɪ-faɪ/)](/about.html) is one of the inaugural NSF AI research institutes. The IAIFI will advance physics knowledge -- from the smallest building blocks of nature to the largest structures in the Universe -- and galvanize AI research innovation. The IAIFI is comprised of both [physics and AI researchers](/people.html) at MIT, Harvard, Northeastern, and Tufts.  Learn more about our [proposed research](/research.html) at the Physics/AI intersection and about our [IAIFI Fellows](/fellows.html) program.

### IAIFI Events

***Announcing the IAIFI Colloquium Series:***  We recently launched our biweekly [virtual colloquium series](events.html)!  For the spring semester, we will showcase IAIFI researchers; see our [events page](events.html) for a full list of talks.  **The next talk is on Thursday, April 1, 2021, when Doug Finkbeiner will talk about "Beyond the Gaussian: A Higher-Order Correlation Statistic for the Interstellar Medium."**  [Sign up for our mailing list](http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/iaifi-news) to receive the Zoom link.  If you missed any of the previous colloquia, you can watch the recordings on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCueoFcGm_15kSB-wDd4CBZA).

### IAIFI Jobs

***IAIFI Project Manager:***  We are looking to hire a [Project Manager](https://careers.peopleclick.com/careerscp/client_mit/external/jobDetails/jobDetail.html?jobPostId=19918&localeCode=en-us) to help coordinate and plan the IAIFI activities.  (Best wishes to our outgoing Project Manager, Melody Abedinejad, in the next phase of her career!)
