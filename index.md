The NSF AI Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions [(IAIFI, pronounced /aɪ-faɪ/)](/about.html) is one of the inaugural NSF AI research institutes. The IAIFI is advancing physics knowledge -- from the smallest building blocks of nature to the largest structures in the Universe -- and galvanizing AI research innovation. The IAIFI is a collaboration of both [physics and AI researchers](/people.html) at MIT, Harvard, Northeastern, and Tufts.  Learn more about our [research](/research.html) at the Physics/AI intersection and about our [IAIFI Fellows](/fellows.html) program.
