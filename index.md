The Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions (IAIFI) is one of the seven inaugural NSF national AI research institutes. The IAIFI will advance physics knowledge -- from the smallest building blocks of nature to the largest structures in the Universe -- and galvanize AI research innovation (see [about IAIFI](/about.html)). The IAIFI is comprised of both physics and AI researchers at MIT, Harvard, Northeastern, and Tufts (see [people](/people.html)).
