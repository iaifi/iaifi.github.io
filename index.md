The NSF AI Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Fundamental Interactions [(IAIFI)](/about.html) is one of the inaugural NSF AI research institutes. The IAIFI will advance physics knowledge -- from the smallest building blocks of nature to the largest structures in the Universe -- and galvanize AI research innovation. The IAIFI is comprised of both [physics and AI researchers](/people.html) at MIT, Harvard, Northeastern, and Tufts.  Learn more about our [proposed research](/research.html) at the Physics/AI intersection and about our [IAIFI Fellows](/fellows.html) program.
