title: Ethics
---

The IAIFI appreciates that the responsible and ethical conduct of research is critical, not only for scientific excellence, but also to maintain the public's trust in science. This goes beyond generating and disseminating knowledge with rigor and integrity; it also includes protecting intellectual property from inappropriate disclosure and treating everyone involved in the scientific process fairly and with respect.

## Responsible Conduct of Research
All IAIFI Junior Investigators are required to complete an online training course in the responsible conduct of research (RCR).

## Ethics-related IAIFI talks
Each semester we hold at least one ethics-related IAIFI talk (colloquium, seminar, or journal club). Past events include:
* April 22, 2021: IAIFI Seminar with [David Kaiser](https://web.mit.edu/dikaiser/www/) (MIT), "Social and Ethical Responsibilities of Computing (SERC): New Activities at MIT";
