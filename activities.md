## Early Career and Equity Committee
The Early Career & Equity Committee (ECEC) serves as an advisory body to IAIFI Management on aspects related to early career researchers and DEI, as well as to oversee the well-being and working environment of all IAIFI members. Their goal is to create an equitable, inclusive, welcoming, and enjoyable place of work, where people of all backgrounds and career stages can feel supported to do their best work and advance forward in their careers in an environment free from discrimination and injustice.

## Education and Workforce Development

### IAIFI Fellowship Program
Of critical importance to the IAIFI vision is our IAIFI Fellows program, which aims to recruit and train the most talented, promising, and diverse group of researchers at an early stage of their careers. These Fellows will spark vital interdisciplinary, multi-investigator, multi-subfield collaborations. Such collaborations have immense power to generate new ideas and approaches, to facilitate abstracting physics challenges beyond their native domains, and to instill a common language across disciplines. Our program aims to appoint three new postdoctoral IAIFI Fellows each academic year, for a three-year fellowship term each.

### Interdisciplinary PhD Program
Many PhD students in the MIT Physics Department already incorporate probability, statistics, computation, and data analysis into their thesis research. These techniques are becoming increasingly important for both experimental and theoretical physics research, with ever-growing datasets, more sophisticated physics simulations, and cutting-edge machine learning developments. This degree provides essential training for students working with these techniques, as well as facilitates mentoring relationships with SDSC experts outside of Physics.

## Knowledge Transfer

### IAIFI Public Colloquia
The IAIFI Colloquia series kicked off on February 4, 2021 and has continued as a biweekly series during the academic year. All colloquia are simulcast to YouTube as well, increasing attendance and broadening participation.

### Partnership Hub
We are in the process of developing partnerships across both industry and academia. If you are interested in discussing partnership opportunities with IAIFI, [contact Todd Zickler](mailto:zickler@seas.harvard.edu), IAIFI Knowledge Transfer Coordinator. 

## Community Building

### IAIFI Discussion Seminars
The IAIFI Discussion Seminars kicked off on February 11, 2021 and has continued as a biweekly series during the academic year. Discussion seminars are open to IAIFI members and continue to be held virtually over Zoom.

### IAIFI Journal Club
The IAIFI Journal Club was founded in November 2020. It is open to IAIFI members and meets every other week during the academic year. It provides junior members with an opportunity to share their research, especially with other junior members, in a relatively informal setting, fostering community and cross-disciplinary interaction.
