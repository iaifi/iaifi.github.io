The IAIFI is involved in many activities in the areas of education and workforce development, outreach, and knowledge transfer.

This page is under construction. Efforts in this area include creating an interdisciplinary PhD degree at MIT in Physics, Statistics, and Data Science, developing online courses in AI, establishing a MicroMasters degree program at MIT for students from non-traditional backgrounds, a K-12 program and other outreach efforts, and numerous partnerships with industry.
